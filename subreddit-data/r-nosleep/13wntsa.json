    "postText": "The common consensus on what a curse even is can be ambiguous, so many cultures and ideas reframe and retool to fit the central tenets of their thematic cores. One thing is common amongst all interpretations however, their aim is to cause harm. One might wonder at what point is a curse conceived, not just the rituals and requirements that are needed to conjure a curse. No, what is it that makes up a curse, what feeds it? Some might answer hate or jealousy, and while those might be true for some. For me, the curse I bore and the curses I will bear are made up of one thing. Resentment.\n\nI first noticed its infection one morning while getting dressed for classes. Running my fingers along the slight depression brought out goosebumps. It was slightly tender and if I pressed on it hard it elicited a painful pinch that caused my insides to tangle in panic. Withdrawing my fingers to inspect them I noted a slickness I couldn\u2019t account for. A slight black tint colored my fingertips and I quickly rinsed them under hot water but it did little to wash away the wave of anxiety that had come over me. I tried to push it aside, I had classes, term papers, and tests to worry about. I held out until the middle of my 3rd class, by then all I could think about was the series of horrible and fatal medical implications of the indentation. I ran all the way home, body wracked with shivers, and slammed myself inside my dorm bathroom, stripped off my shirt, and took a good look at it. It had gotten deeper, at least 2 centimeters into my chest now. It was where my sternum was, dead center between my two pectoral muscles. I pushed my finger in and it actually gave some, causing a shudder of agony to blossom and ride through every nerve in my body. I spent the rest of the day researching what I could, some stuff about dietary insufficiencies causing swelling and easily depressed skin, but this was different. The anxiety attacks started then and continued for the next few hours. My roommate walked in during the midst of one and saw my huddled form, trying to breathe. I heard the audible click of his tongue and he left.\n\n3 am neared and I still hadn\u2019t escaped that sinking feeling, the one that feels like an endless plunge towards death, and all the while your lungs struggle to pull enough air to fuel a scream. Drowning in plain sight. I looked desperately through Jake\u2019s things and found a bottle of Benadryl. I washed a couple of them down and waited until my eyelids grew heavy. I was barely able to crawl into bed before I fell into a deep slumber. The dreams it brought were bizarre and vivid. I was wandering through a landscape of abandoned suburbs, going from door to door, looking for one that was the right color. It was late into the night when I finally found it, a dim street lamp casting down an amber spotlight in front of a dilapidated two-story with a red door.\n\nThe door opened as I walked up to it, revealing a barren living room lit by a corner lamp that flickered every few seconds. At its center was a cobblestone well, ancient and unnerving. I recognized it. I had seen it countless times. On my worst days, I had dreamt of standing before it, yearning for hope or absolution. I had been silent instead, letting all I could not say seep into it. This inverted well, one that fed on despair instead of dreams, was now vibrating, shifting. Something was rising from its depths to greet me and I was ready for it, yearned for it. Black fluid erupted from its opening, spraying the ceiling and walls and splattering across my face.\n\nSomewhere, a scream was reaching a fever pitch. I looked down and saw that my chest had split open and the black fluid was streaming down in a cascade of pitch. An eye blossomed from the depths of that gaping ravine in my chest. It stared, focused, and recognition flooded into the empty white. From the hole in my chest, something was rising - a realization. The screaming\u2026 it had been me the whole time.\n\nI jolted awake, the pain in my chest the first thing to greet me. I heaved to suck in a breath and my senses came alive. Next was the sweat-slick coat that had pooled around me and I turned over to flip on a lamp. Light flooded my vision, but still, I was surrounded by darkness. No, not darkness, but stains. Black ink had seemingly spurted from my chest and splattered my bedding and floor. I ran my finger through it, all along my sternum, but I could not find the indentation, nor a source for the fluid.\n\nI got up in a panic, looking around the room. I was alone, my roommate never having returned, but there was a trail of black ooze. I followed the most prominent streak to a corner. There was a lump there, a polished shiny black orb where the oily ooze seemingly seeped from. My heart thundered as I approached it, I swore I thought I saw it twitch. I was in the middle of my hands and knees crawling towards it when it jerked, moved, and stood.\n\nI fell back on my ass letting out a half yelp, frozen as my gaze locked with it. It was the size of a rabbit, its tar-black skin reflective and polished. It had these beady eyes that were somehow darker than the rest of its body, and it waddled forward on stubby legs no longer than two inches. It had arms too, stubs too, and they reached for me. I was scooting away from its path when it spoke in a pained and squeaky voice as if its anatomy was ill-fitted for human speech, even its grasp of human words was feeble.\n\n\u201cNo harm. I\u2019m an ally.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I couldn\u2019t help but respond.\n\n\u201cYou fed me, so now I repay you?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow? In what way? What are you?\u201d\n\nIt blinked as if contemplating how to answer my barrage of questions. It didn\u2019t have a mouth, but it spoke regardless. There was distance to its voice, so I was certain that it didn\u2019t speak directly to my mind, but then again I didn\u2019t even think that was possible until now.\n\n\u201cI am grown, don\u2019t know from where, or why. I think I could be a tool or weapon. I eat bad feelings, but I was left with no one around to feed me. Then you came and fed me, for a long time. Now I\u2019m finally strong enough to repay.\u201d\n\n\u201cRepay me how?\u201d\n\n\u201cI have fed on the dark of your heart. I know what it desires, I can take the shape of a curse,\u201d it said\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to curse me? As repayment?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, that\u2019s not what was in your hearts. Yes, you hated yourself, but you hate others more. I can be the curse you cast on them.\u201d\n\nSomething clicked in place and made its way closer to my mind, but didn\u2019t bridge the distance entirely. It spoke, knew that I\u2019d ask it how.\n\n\u201cPick the kind of curse. I can be misfortune, blindness, madness\u2026 even death, a killing curse,\u201d it said.\n\nI reached towards it, even as its body distorted and elongated and reshaped into a foot-long, skinny, jagged oily centipede. I froze but it skittered forward, crawled across the back of my hand, and wrapped around my wrist. It tickled my skin, slick but warm. Almost uncomfortably so.\n\n\u201cPick the kind of curse you want me to be, and feed me to whom you want to inflict. It\u2019s easy, but curses burn up in daylight if not attached. You\u2019ll have a few hours past dawn before I turn to ash.\u201d\n\nIt fell silent afterward as if slumbering, but I couldn\u2019t sleep. I sat in the corner thinking, watching the black stains left by the living curse dry up and evaporate into nothing.  I had to look periodically at the oily centipede wrapped around my wrist to remind myself that I wasn\u2019t dreaming, but all it did was convince me that I had careened off the precipice of sanity into some functional hysteria. I sat there until the sun rose, and like a clockwork mechanism, I got dressed and went to class. I was on autopilot, more depersonalized than I had ever felt before I watched myself go through the motions of my life. It should have been a cry for help, you could see it spelled out clearly as day and no one could have missed it. But they did - or rather, they chose to ignore it, because that was what you were supposed to do with people like me. Dull rage set in and it was what I stewed in as the hours ticked by, a building fury that could have blown but only boiled over and settled into dejected acceptance. I was ready to leave it at that, to let myself fade into a shadow like I had my entire life. To give up and crawl away to some recess, never to be found. But the searing pain of dozens of clawed insect legs digging into my flesh brought back presence of mind \u201cNow. *Now!* ***Now! NOW!***\u201d a voice chirped. I ran into a storage closet, barred the door, and pulled back the sleeve that hid the living curse.\n\n\u201cWhat is it, are you about to die?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot die, return. Back to the labyrinth. Pick a curse now, feed me to your enemy, before I disappear and all you\u2019ll be left with is ash.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd if I haven\u2019t picked anyone? If I don\u2019t want to hurt anyone?\u201d\n\n\u201cThen let me burn in the light, let me go, never visit my well, never feed me again. Move forward from your life, move away from me, and you\u2019ll be free of me\u201d\n\nIt could be that easy to rid myself of this wretched thing. I thought about my day, my life, and the people closest to me. I couldn\u2019t let go, not when they had all walked by ashamed or indifferent, or worst of all, fearful. I had done nothing and they feared me.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t let it go, I can\u2019t. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll do, but I can\u2019t move on from this. I can\u2019t give you up, but I can\u2019t choose someone to suffer you.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen eat me.\u201d\n\nI looked at the wriggling centipede confused, black fluid dripping from its body.\n\n\u201cIf you eat me, you inflict the curse upon yourself. Not at full potency, but I\u2019ll live until you\u2019re ready to choose. If you hate enough, if you have the resolve, you can cast a shadow of my curse on all who meet your gaze, but you must hurry, my time\u2026 fades.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what to pick. I don\u2019t want to suffer.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen pick the curse that causes the least pain.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich is? I don\u2019t know, pick for me!\u201d\n\n\u201cI am delirium, now eat me, before it\u2019s too late.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t notice any change in the curse, except for the small cracks appearing in its carapace and the fraying of its antenna. I hesitated until a large crack formed across its back; at that moment, I hoisted it up and opened my mouth wide, closing my eyes as I lowered it. It did the rest of the work, jerking free of my grip and slithering down my throat with brute force, trailing that oily substance, I gagged, screamed, tears ran and I choked. But once it was down and settled I was alone in that room, nothing different.\n\nUntil I stepped out, and it began. A blurring of the world, where every sound was too sharp and grating, every color too vibrant. My head was swelling with immense pressure as it was filled with hundreds of trivial conversations, all spewing from the mouths of every student and professor in this wing. I couldn\u2019t handle it, so I ran, flinging the doors open to the outside.\n\nExcept outside wasn\u2019t outside, no, the doors opened up to a hallway I had been trying to forget all my life, framed with pictures of me and my family. I turned, hoping I could reach the living room so I could leave through the front door but what faced me was another room, one I had forgotten about until now. A barred door, walls burned black, stained with soot and char. A sound jolted me back around, the sound of a belt being unbuckled and fabric hitting the floor. Panic rose within me and I felt like I was in free fall, plummeting from astral orbit, through the earth's crust, and straight into the pits of hell. Except I wasn\u2019t. No, I was in my middle school nurse's office. The scent of floor polish and cheap perfume tickled my nose.\n\n\u201cIf it hurts you can stop it anytime, you know? Just change your habits, it\u2019s not that hard,\u201d\n\nMs. Rena, my middle school nurse, was talking to me. I stared into her eyes, and the world quieted and came into focus. They were green, as beautiful as emeralds. I couldn\u2019t help but stare at them every chance I got. They brought forth feelings within me I had never felt before, an awakening. I blinked and they were burning now, bright green flames that sloughed the flesh from her face and I turned away and screamed. The scream pitched, bent, and distorted into a siren, ascending and descending endlessly. I don\u2019t know how long I was caught in its loop but I couldn\u2019t cling onto a single coherent thought longer than a second, as if my mind had been partitioned half a dozen times and all were battling for the sphere of influence that was my perception.\n\nThen clarity, or an illusion of such. In reality, it was only a fleeting break from the delirium, long enough for me to gather my faculties so that the second dive into madness would hurt just that much more. But time was relative here, stretching out longer than it had any right to. The curse was there, in the hallway of my dorm, no longer a centipede but a tall humanoid thing, seemingly made of old motor oil.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happening? What did you do to me?!\u201d I pleaded.\n\n\u201cYou are suffering the curse of delirium. You chose this, remember?\u201d it said, its voice no longer airy and whistling, like a bird\u2019s. Its speech was no longer jilted and tenuous. Now when it spoke, its voice was deep and full of power.\n\n\u201cYou said it would be weaker, subdued.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is subdued, I\u2019m a powerful curse after all.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are you? Where do you come from, I don\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, I\u2019m searching for the answer myself. I was malnourished for so long that my mind splintered, I suffered my own madness, and I just know bits and pieces now. I know that in the city of Cradle, the word they call me means \u2018Demon Seed\u2019. That\u2019s all I know of my identity.\u201d\n\n\u201cI-I didn\u2019t want this,\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll grow accustomed to it, with time. Not fully, if you could ignore the delirium it wouldn\u2019t be much of a curse. If it\u2019s too much for you to handle, if the pain is unbearable, you can always make it go away.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow?\u201d\n\n\u201cExpel me from your body, feed me to someone else, or let the sun take me.\u201d\n\nI exhaled long and slow, and felt the prickling at the corner of my mind. The madness was near, but all I could feel was anger. At the curse, at myself, at the world. I turned away and faced a world of static and incomprehensible whispers, deafening and all-consuming. I collapsed into myself, held my hands to my ears, and balled into the fetal position. It did little to shut out all that was happening, but it did dull it for a moment until a quiet, throaty keening cut through and pierced my mind directly. I imagined a small undying animal having an army knife stab them at consistent intervals, the pace changing periodically so it could never get used to the pain. And then the violence was reflected onto me except there was no perpetrator. An invisible force sliced into the flesh of my sides, my back, until I was ridden with countless wounds. The pain spurred me to crawl forward on all fours, hoping to escape it but it was endless. I was bleeding so much, black blood, my blood was black. I laughed, then cried, and then crawled forward as the stabbings continued, except now the pain had dulled into an ache that still caused my breath to hitch.\n\nI crawled for what seemed like hours, never getting used to the barrage of thoughts, images, and sounds, all the while the stabbing refused to stop. Even after my body had been shredded to ribbons and I had been bled of all its blood it continued, lazily now, as if the invisible force had grown tired but not enough to cease. Then I hit a wall, flesh, thin, like an amniotic sac, and on impulse I pushed through into it, harder and harder until it started to rip. Somewhere someone was breathing heavily, no more than one, with a rising rhythm and intensity, like a panic attack reaching its peak. I struggled forward, trying to break the damn thing, but it would not give. I was exhausted and so collapsed into it as if sleeping, but time passed and sleep did not come. But the end of the breathing did, once it reached a fever pitch. I shifted, realizing the stabbing had stopped, trying to move but then of all times the amniotic sac burst and I fell into whatever lay beyond it.\n\nI was in my dorm room, a break in the madness. I was free for a moment, act, I had to act. Dawn was starting to peek through the window blinds. I stood up and froze, seeing what the rays of light were cast onto. My roommate Jake lay in his bed, naked. A woman just as naked was wrapped around him, body slick with sweat, its scent perfuming the room. He had seen me suffering,  in the midst of a panic attack, left me to cope with it alone, and when I hadn\u2019t returned he took the chance not to look for me or tell anyone, instead using it for his own benefit. Anger coursed through my veins, a fresh injection of hate kicking me into action. I opened my mouth and with my pointer finger and thumb reached in, the curse met me halfway and slid into position. I gripped it and pulled it, hand over hand now as a seemingly endless centipede being expelled from my stomach. I looked at the black segmented body, it writhed and moved in such a way that it reminded me a bit of an umbilical cord, and in a way, it was. A curse was being birthed, having grown stronger after I had housed and fed it with my own being. It was time to cut the cord then, I walked over to the pair as I pulled the last of the length free.\n\nThe curse popped out like a cork, sending a spray of black fluid across the couple. Droplets of varying sizes landed and stained the woman\u2019s breasts, most of it pooling in between them at her sternum. I stifled a laugh as that\u2019s where I had first gestated this curse. I looked at Jake, the black spray had stained his face, beard, and clavicle, and a particularly large globule resting upon his lower lip. I shifted my gaze to the wriggling centipede before me. It was at least four feet long now and twice its original width.\n\nI shuddered, clarity flooded over me, and at that moment I realized that sometimes clarity was just perspective. I thought I knew suffering, thought I knew what it meant to shuffle through every day dreading that the next day would be more of the same. But the inescapable madness brought a new understanding to me. I could have changed. At any point in time, I could have ended my ostracization. Sure, it was socially imposed, but it was not an incurable delirium. Follow the rules, conform, and you\u2019ll be mostly fine, you can make the hurt stop anytime you want. So why didn\u2019t I, why can\u2019t I now at this very moment? I knew now that it was because it would be a rejection of self, the world goes on and on about how you should be yourself. That in itself was a virtue lauded and held up as one of the most important facets of existence. But now I know what they really meant was \u201cOperate within the constantly shifting parameters of acceptability - fail to adhere, evolve or predict, and you are a threat.\u201d The true self that others reveled in evaded people like me, instead we had to construct a facade we passed off as real in order to thrive.\n\nBut so many didn\u2019t, couldn\u2019t, wouldn\u2019t. How could they? It was all they knew, how could you discard that which defined them, the filter of their reality? I know what I am now, a worm that slinked through grime and lived in darkness, and when others took me and held me to the light, saying, \u201cSee, this is how you should be, and why you should be, it\u2019s for the better of everyone,\u201d it didn\u2019t bring me to enlightenment, but to resentment and hate. I knew what I could do to make them see more than just a freak, a threat, but unconsciously I never took the steps because I knew only what it was to exist within the margins, in a periphery. An exile imposed by all, including myself.\n\nI held the curse higher, feeling grateful that I had survived it, suffered it, and was blessed by its clarity. Light streamed in now as the sun crossed the horizon into a bright morning. The curse was still, despite the lethal light upon it. Let it go and move on, or revel in it? I looked back down at the pair, at Jake. He was an acceptable version of me, softly rebellious. Had thoughts, beliefs, mannerisms, and behaviors that neared the boundaries but never crossed them. Scruffy-faced, soft-eyed, short hair spikey and messy but never disheveled, charming in an irreverent way, unassuming cock but he fucked like a jackhammer obviously. An outsider that wasn\u2019t really an outsider, he never was the great other that haunted dreams and fueled paranoia. I held the curse out in front of them and spoke to it.\n\n\u201cYour choice, Demon Seed. Wither in the sun, or choose one to torment. I don\u2019t care which.\u201d\n\nIt was still for a moment before diving into Jake's mouth. Silently, effortlessly, it slipped inside him and was gone. I walked out of the room, legs wobbling a bit, I was riding a high I had never felt before.\n\nJake was dead by the end of the month, he had been institutionalized until he wasn\u2019t and then he stumbled onto train tracks. Rest is history, no body left to bury. His girlfriend, lover, or whatever the fuck was the one to break the news to me. Thought because I was his roommate I cared or at least should care. It was a few weeks later when I felt that sting and oil-slick fluid in my sternum, Demon Seed, the curse had enjoyed itself.\n\nTwice more I\u2019ve birthed a curse, let it choose its victim, let Demon Seed choose its form. He is the shaky finger of tragedy that strikes without cause or rhyme, deliriously pointed at someone, anyone. And I am the great well of resentment that feeds him. We are the what world needs, a calamity, the great other, something to fear, something to hate. And with each glare and impassioned condemnation, the curse grows stronger within [me.](https://www.reddit.com/r/grimoireofmadness/)\n___\n\n[TW](https://twitter.com/SantiagoDelMar3)",
