Even though this had all been what I was hoping for over the course of the last week and a half, going through with everything I would need to do to meet up with Anastasia at her house in the middle of the night still seemed way scarier than just dealing with the clock\u2019s nightly threats against my life which, by that point, had become something of a routine for me.\n\n\rAt 11:00 PM, my parents looked like they had gone to sleep.  I would wait another hour as Anastasia had advised.  I would leave at midnight.  And that wouldn\u2019t be a problem since it was a Friday night, and my clock wasn\u2019t going through its usual changes.  By that time, the clock hadn\u2019t started glowing or even turning the slightest shade of red.  \n\n\r When midnight did come, the clock was still in the same state as it was at 11.  My parents were still asleep.  They hadn\u2019t even gotten up for a bathroom break.  I turned on the kitchen lights, hoping it wouldn\u2019t wake my parents up.  It didn\u2019t.  I went to the kitchen table to take the keys to my father's truck.  They weren\u2019t there.  I had no idea where else to look for them.  \n\n\rI tried looking all around the kitchen and living room.  I checked mom and dad's bathroom.  Nothing.  I didn\u2019t know how I would make my way to Anastasia\u2019s house now.  I could just picture her, spending all night at her back door, waiting for me to show up, without me ever coming.  Maybe I'd find the keys tomorrow.  But that seemed like a fat chance since dad wasn't gonna be driving anywhere tomorrow. \r  \n I wouldn't have him to find them for me.  It looked like I\u2019d have to wait a whole nother week on any answers now. \n\n\rI had recently invested in a new watch.  I had some allowance money left over from when I was a kid.  My school has a little gift shop with small things like school-themed wristwatches, so after my last class of the day, I stopped by and picked up a College High watch so I could check the time without needing to look at the clock in my room or at my phone.  I'm bringing this up because at around this point I was watching with increasing anxiety as time was passing by.  According to the watch, the time now was 12:30 and I still didn\u2019t have any access to my father\u2019s car.  \n\n\rI was already feeling hopeless enough, just thanks to that fact, but then I remembered that I still didn\u2019t even know how to get to Anastasia\u2019s house.  \r  \nSince I still didn\u2019t know where the keys were and it didn\u2019t look like I\u2019d find them any time soon, I figured I\u2019d take a break from looking, and go on my phone to look up her address on google maps.  I knew I shouldn\u2019t have been using my phone since it was apparently super important not to let it die.  I figured it must've been one of those rules like keeping my head under the blanket when the monster showed up, along with the rest of my body.  But I would only need my phone for a few minutes.  Just enough time to look at google maps and sketch out a rough map of the route from my house to Anastasia\u2019s.\n\n\rThe first thing I noticed when I typed in her address was that, thankfully, her house wasn\u2019t too horrendously far away from mine.  It would just be a 4-mile drive.  So hopefully this meant that, if push did come to shove, I could still just walk there if I had too.  I\u2019d probably be late, but that would be better than not showing up at all.  So, I at least had that as a back-up plan if nothing else.  But it would still be risky.  It would take a lot of time to walk there, and then to walk back.  Maybe mom and dad would be up after all was said and done.  Maybe they\u2019d hear me coming back inside the house, regardless of how I made it to Anastasia\u2019s.  Maybe I\u2019d wake up Anastasia\u2019s parents too.\n\n\rSince I only had an hour and thirty-five minutes left, I had no time to worry all that much about any of this though.  I had to get to work, jotting down the path to Anastasia\u2019s house.  I would turn left out of my driveway, stay on that road for about a mile and a half, then turn right and stay on that road for another half-mile, then turn left for another mile, and then left again for a final fourth mile.\r  \n Another thing I noticed was that Anastasia lived out in the middle of absolute nowhere.  I thought I did too, but Anastasia\u2019s house was on a whole nother level of out there.  \n\nFortunately, that meant I\u2019d be driving pretty much exclusively on backroads, so it would literally be impossible to take a wrong turn after I made my first turn out of the driveway and the next right turn after that after about a mile and a half.  It also meant that I would be pretty much guaranteed not to run into any other drivers, especially at that time of night.  But I guess her remote address explained why she didn\u2019t have the internet connection she would need to do a video call.\n\n\r Since it was a quarter to 1 by that point, after I found out how to drive to her house, I put on all the layers I could find, took the flashlight that my mom had given me for the walk I had went on during the week prior, and started trying to walk over there, without my parents\u2019 car, despite her recommendations.  Even though it was four miles by car, I wouldn't have to worry about staying on the road if I just walked there.  If I walked in a straight line, I could get there in just over 2 and half miles or so.  I had decided to leave, not out of the front door, but out of the door in the hallway that led to the garage.  That door made less noise than the front door. \n\n\rUnfortunately, I started to get the sense that I hadn\u2019t thought this plan through when I realized I would still have to open the garage door in order to make my way into the outside world.  Which, yeah, made considerably more noise than the front door.  But then I realized it didn\u2019t matter, since I was gonna have to open the garage door anyway if I wanted to get the car out of the garage and onto the road.  So, I had still made the right decision.  Except no I hadn\u2019t, because I had just remembered that I still didn\u2019t have the car keys, and so I was supposed to be ditching the whole car idea anyway and had just randomly forgotten about all of that.\n\n\rI know that all probably sounded pretty messy and wasn't very easy to follow, but maybe someone else reading with ADHD can relate.  But anyway, confusing thought processes aside, I walked out the front door and started making my way to Anastasia\u2019s on foot.  It really was freezing though.  I really did wonder if I could actually make it all the way to her house.  \r  \nBefore I even made it to the end of the driveway, I began to change my mind and decided driving really would be a more reasonable alternative.  Obviously, the backroads wouldn\u2019t even be close to snow plowed.  But the snow only looked to be about maybe 6 or 7 inches deep, which was still driveable enough with the snow-proof tires that my dad had on his truck.  This level of snow isn't all that uncommon around here, so those tires are pretty much a must-have for anybody living in deathly cold climates like us.\n\n\rSo, I could still drive despite the snow, albeit only very slowly what with how much the snow would slow me down.  But I was supposed to be driving slowly anyway because I was only 14 and didn\u2019t have a license.  But I still couldn\u2019t drive without those keys.  Then I remembered I still had my bike in the garage.  It was supposedly \u201call terrain\u201d, so hopefully that meant it could handle the snow.  I went into the garage, got my bike out, and tried riding it.  Unfortunately, the tires on that bike weren\u2019t even close to capable of handling the snow.  I tried pedaling as hard as I could but hardly got anywhere before falling over.  I had a feeling this would probably happen.  It seemed like a dumb idea but, since I didn\u2019t want to steal my dad\u2019s truck and I couldn\u2019t even seem to find his keys anyway, I figured it was at least worth a shot.\n\n\rI was just about to say \u201cfuck it\u201d and try meeting Anastasia again on some other night when, just as I had put my bike down in the garage, I had seen that my dad had left behind his keys in the key slot of his car door.  Apparently, the reason that they weren\u2019t where they usually were was because my father had locked the truck and just forgot to take his keys with him.  I turned the key sticking out of the driver\u2019s side door and it opened.  So I really could get inside of his truck after all.\r  \n\r  \nI put the key into the ignition and then put it in reverse.  The truck made quite a bit of noise when its ignition started, so I had just hoped that I hadn\u2019t woken up my parents with that.  Luckily, my garage is on the other side of the house from where my parents sleep, so the sound did at least have a long way to travel.  Once I started backing the truck out of the garage and into the driveway, I ran into another problem.  Since the roads weren\u2019t plowed, they were just as snowy as anywhere else.  So even with the rearview mirror, I had no idea where my driveway stopped and the road started.  I figured I would just keep backing up until I felt like I\u2019d gone far enough.  \n\n\rFar enough came sooner than expected though.  Eventually, the car had very clearly backed into the grass, meaning I had backed up too far.  Fortunately, I saw that I hadn\u2019t veered too much out of the straight line I was trying to go in, because driving in reverse meant I could see the truck\u2019s tracks right in front of me with the help of the headlights.  The car fell onto the grass from back to front.  So that meant that the road was now directly in front of me.  Since I needed to take a left from my house if I was facing away from it, and I was now facing the opposite direction given that I was looking right at it, that meant that I now had to make a right turn in order to still be going in the right direction.\n\n\rI took a moment to make sure my logic was right and, once I felt confident, I turned the truck right and then tried to feel for where the road was based on how well the truck was able to move.  Eventually I was able to drive relatively smoothly, so I took that to mean that I was back on the road.  I tried to angle myself properly so that I wouldn\u2019t wind up veering off the road again.  Now and then I would wind up driving myself off the road.  But since I was only going like 5 miles an hour, I was able to catch myself before the car wound up falling into any ditches or something.  \n\n\rSince the road was entirely empty, I eventually made the decision to just drive in the middle of the road.  Or at least, wherever I thought the middle of the road was.  That way, I\u2019d limit the likelihood of driving myself off the right edge.\r  \nAfter about 20 or 30 minutes of driving painfully slowly, I finally saw the sign for my first turn.  Since all the turns I was making were fairly sharp ones, they were basically all 90 degrees, there were road signs that I could use to gauge when I should turn without needing to see the road itself.  So I still knew when to do it, even though I couldn\u2019t see the road under all the snow and I couldn't use GPS since my phone had to stay on the charger at all costs.  \n\n\rBut the snow still made those sharp turns very difficult to make.  So I had to start all my turns pretty far ahead of where they actually would\u2019ve been in the road.  Naturally, I wound up driving off the road when making literally all of them.  But I was always able to work out where the road was supposed to be soon enough.  I guess since people are more likely to veer off the road when making turns as opposed to when they\u2019re driving straight, there didn\u2019t seem to be any ditches around all those sharp turns, thankfully enough.\n\n\rAfter I made that first turn, I checked my watch.  It was now a quarter after 1.  I still had 50 minutes to go.  I wasn\u2019t making great time, but I had still made it about a third of the way in only about 25 minutes.  If I kept up the pace, I\u2019d be there after just under an hour of driving.  Which would put me there a little bit after 2 AM.   So, pretty much exactly at 2:05, the time we agreed on.\n\n\rI kept on driving incredibly slowly for what felt like forever.  Finally I had made my last turn, and after a bit, I could see lights from the houses off the side of the road in the distance.  I figured that this must be the neighborhood Anastasia lived in.  If you could even call it a neighborhood.  The houses were so hugely spaced out that it hardly even made sense to say you had neighbors.  But then, she really did live out in the middle of nowhere.\n\n\rEvery time I passed by a house, I got out of the car and looked for an address with my flashlight.  This slowed me down, but it still ensured that I would be headed for the right house.  I kept the slip of paper with her address on it since I knew that, without that sheet, I\u2019d absolutely forget which address was hers.  I was actually pretty pleased with myself for having thought ahead like that.  I usually didn\u2019t.  I guess I still usually don\u2019t, if I\u2019m being honest.\n\n\rI was worried that this whole procedure of getting out of the car to scope out for an address every time I passed a new house would make me late.  But fortunately, Anastasia\u2019s house was the third house I came across on that street.  So thankfully, I didn\u2019t wind up having to check that many houses and it only cost me maybe another 5 minutes.  When I checked my watch, I found I had actually arrived sooner than I had thought.  Even with checking every house I had come across up to that point for the address, it was only 1:50.  \n\n\rI had made it with 15 minutes to spare.  That meant I had made that last two thirds of my trip in about the same amount of time that I had spent on my first, meaning I had wound up going twice as fast.  I suppose as I had gotten comfortable with driving, I sped up the car a little without even realizing it.  Doubling your speed sounds like it should be a huge difference, but when you\u2019re only going from 5 miles per hour to 10, I guess it must be pretty hard to notice.\r  \n \n\nSince I had so much time left and the weather outside was still hellishly cold, I stayed in the truck with the heater blaring.  After a couple of minutes, I noticed an ominous red light glowing out of the side of the house.  That seemed off to me since surely that couldn\u2019t have anything to do with Anastasia\u2019s clock.  It wasn\u2019t a weeknight and even if it was, it was still well past midnight.  I remembered what she had told me about how I was still on Stage One.  Maybe the fact that she was on a much later stage had something to do with what I was seeing.  The fact that I was still on Stage One did, after all, seem like it had something to do with the fact that I was only threatened by the clock on weeknights.\n\n\rMy curiosity had gotten the better of me, and so I braved the cold and snow to go check out what was happening.  There was a window on the side of the house.  The curtains were left open so with the red light blaring from it, I could see inside fairly easily.  Especially since the house was only one story, so it wasn\u2019t like the window was too high up off the ground for me to see through, either.  \r  \n\r  \nMy fears had been confirmed.  Upon looking into the room, I could see exactly where the red light was emanating from: the clock on the nightstand.  The face inside was as clear as ever.  Every feature slowly growing, approaching the glass in front of the clock\u2019s face.  But it wasn\u2019t looking at me.  It was very clearly directing its vile and hateful gaze at the person under the covers.  \r  \n The person had her head covered underneath the blanket, so I couldn\u2019t directly tell who it was. But I figured it had to be Anastasia.  For one, there was no way in hell anybody else in her family was playing Sleep Points too.  I mean, what are the odds of that?  And for another, the room pretty clearly looked like it belonged to a teenage girl about Anastasia\u2019s age.  Everything looked like it was pink and had all kinds of frills to it.  I even noticed some boyband poster on the other end of the room.  If this wasn\u2019t the most stereotypical teenage girl\u2019s room, I had no fucking clue what was.\n\n\rFinally, 2 o\u2019clock had come.  I could see why she had told me 2:05.  I had never seen the monster from the clock break out.  I had always had my head under the covers whenever it happened.  But since this was Anastasia\u2019s clock and not mine and since the face in the clock was staring her down and not me, and since I had an entire wall separating me from the thing, I guess I somehow managed to muster up the courage to watch the monster in action.\n\n\rSuddenly, the hands and numbers of the clock\u2019s face began to almost melt into the monster\u2019s face.  It had broken out of the sheet of glass holding it back.  But that seemed to be the only thing that was broken.  The rest of the actual clock remained pretty intact as the unspeakable thing from within started to slither out of the clock and onto the floor.  Since the hands and numbers were still on its face, it kinda looked like they had been imprinted on it like some kind of tattoo artwork.  It very quickly expanded in size and let out this unholy screech that I could hear very loudly even from behind the window.  But Anastasia was still sleeping very peacefully.  Totally motionless like nothing at all was going on.  \n\n\rIt prowled around her bed, looking for the slightest sign of motion.  It looked almost skeptically at her.  As if it could tell whether she was really sleeping or not.  And God only knows what would\u2019ve happened to her if she wasn\u2019t.  Eventually, the monster seemed satisfied with what he saw and shrunk himself down to his original size.  He slid back into the clock, and as he did so, there was one last glow of red light.  The glass had been restored.  It was now 2:01.",
