    "postText": "(UPDATE)\nMy name is Darwin Michigan. You could say that I'm a dedicated scientist in finding the paranormal and all. I know that many people consider the connection between spiritual and science is a big joke but I can tell you it holds many mysteries in the other plane of existence.\n\nThe reason why I became a scientist for the paranormal was the time when I was 5 years old. I met a friend who is not like others. I still remember how he can shape shifts into an animal. It was so fun when we were racing, playing knights, reading DC and marvel comic books together. He was my best friend, even when I go to school we'll always be with each other no matter what. Then when I turned 13, he was gone. Never to be seen again.\n\nI found a note inside of the treehouse we made together. It was heartbreaking for me. Why didn't he tell me this earlier? Well, it said he knows himself to be dangerous and doesn't want me to get hurt by him. I wanted to talk this out but he was already gone.\n\nAfter that, I became more into the paranormal and science. To figure out the people with special abilities or demons or spirits from another plane of existence. I've been mostly ignored by many of my classmates. Except that my science teacher became well aware as to what I'm doing. He thought it was a joke and that I should stop it before I become insane. I know what I'm doing and I'm not letting my sanity slip while I work on the paranormal.\n\nFor a couple of years, I went on to find a job suited for me to start my project. To see the other plane of existence. Many denied my project which wasted so much of my time that I have to travel farther off. Even I have to go to Europe for crying out loud.\n\nFinally, I found a job that accepted my project in the United Kingdom. They told me that I can use the underground base for research and experiments. It was a secret base and of course I can't tell you about it nor the area.\n\nThen, I prepared to begin my project. The spiritual dimension experiment. I have been accompanied with a team that believes similarly to my beliefs and I'm very grateful to have them around. Only 6 of us work together to proceed the project.\n\nA scientist by the name of Geralt Chou, came from Brooklyn, has been supportive of us to keep up and brought snacks and other foods for us to eat. He works on the mathematics methods which helps support my mathematical research. He's a really kind fellow, sometimes a little bit not taking things seriously. I told him that he should be taking the experiment seriously, which he sometimes does and that sometimes gave me a chuckle. He's also someone who loves taking photographs. Every time we had some free time, he would always take a picture of us together just doing stuff on our time. We kept those pictures in the pages of a book we stored in his office and some pictures, I put them on the fridge as a lovely portrait.\n\nA constructor by the name of Ronald Gilligan, came from Russia, who works on the construction of the materials, is a storyteller of the mythology. He's so fascinated in the mythos that he believed so much of the stories. I thought of telling him that it's not real but that'll break his spirit, I worry. So I didn't tell him and he kept telling stories of Olympus and how Hades and Persephone got together. It was nice hearing stories from him. Except some of my team members really got annoyed. He's also been to boxing matches, as well as getting beaten up in his first fight in middle school. Behind his scraggly beard was a scar he got when he was fighting in a boxing match underground with a man with sharp brass knuckles.\n\nThe one who gets annoyed is a scientist by the name of Billy West, came from London, who is the one who works on particles for the machine to create a portal. He's an ass. A lot more of an ass as you would expect. Nearly ever hour he mocks my teammates for being low life and seen as rubbish. I wanted to get him out but there are times where he showed kindness to us. In times when we were about to give up from hopelessness, he told us. \"Hey! Get up bozos! We're not going to give up that easily and we're going to get your project finished! Get some inspiration and motivation in your thick skulls!\" That which actually shows his good side. He may say cruel things but being kind and supportive is enough to make us keep going. He kept bragging about himself being the best doctor in the world which sounds really funny and sometimes I couldn't help myself to just laugh. But he is the best doctor around us. He's the only doctor we could ever have.\n\nHis partner is Cody Armstrong, big man, came from Ohio. I don't know how he manages to stay calm from Billy's cruel words. He's a really calm, strong built man, who seem to be the exact opposite of Billy. It felt cool to see the both of them working together. Sometimes Billy thought that Cody did a mistake and Cody had to ask why instead of saying sorry. It didn't sound like an argument and instead sounded more like therapy for some reason. Of course, we had conversations over how we felt everyday and he's been helping me hold myself together.\n\nAnd lastly, the one who brings in materials and helps out with the construction is Rishika Belmont, came from Melbourne Victoria. She's a really nervous women when it comes to teamwork. But in times of getting materials and building constructions, she took things really seriously which made her exhausted and we never get to talk to her until she finished her work. I tried to talk her out but she distances herself which me and my other members got worried for her health. I'd hoped that Ronald or Geralt could talk to her but that did nothing.\n\nI consider my members as my friends since we've been together on this for couple of 3 years. I'm hoping that after we've discovered whatever is in there, we could be the one and only scientists who've discovered the afterlife. It sounds crazy but reaching for something impossible can be such a wonderful thing.\n\nBut the result was, different than I thought. What we did that day, where we travelled, is not what we'd worked for but something more bigger and horrifying I couldn't imagine. We couldn't believe what we've discovered and it's more of a warning. I'm writing this now in my new base with a couple of my friends with me. The story I wrote was written in a notebook I carried with me. I don't know if reddit can connect to different worlds or what but I hope it does. This is a warning of what's to come.\n\nOn October 30th, 2083. My team and I have finally finished the machine that opens a doorway to the afterlife. I couldn't believe that we actually gone this far and now we're able to see what lies beyond death. We have many fails through test after test, fixing what's the problem and why. We hoped that this could be it.\n\nI looked around to see my friends wearing jackets and other equipment in case there is anything dangerous happening to us. I can see Geralt having the sense of fear in his eyes. \"Geralt. You alright?\"\n\nHe turned his head towards me, snapping his mind back into reality.\"Yeah. Yeah, I'm just. I don't know what's going to be like there. I'm just trying to tell myself it's going to be alright.\"\n\n\"Don't worry too much Geralt. We stick together on this one.\" Cody said with a bright warm smile on his face. I smiled too and when I look back to Rishika, she was somewhat determined. Not determined for the project to work but something else. I couldn't tell which I asked her.\"Rishika. You don't look alright. Something got in your mind?\" She didn't turn to face me, instead she kept facing the portal. She then said so quietly. \"*I'm ready to go.*\"\n\nAnd with that, the big asshole, Billy West, went to activate the switch. \"Alright maggots! This is where we set off! You bring your weapons because if you haven't, then you're going to get your small brain eaten alive!\"\n\n\"I am not maggot.\" Ronald mutters. I can clearly hear him and if he spoke more louder, then they would start up an argument instead of a fight.\n\nWe brought our own weapons, which I hold a large size hammer that radiates high electricity. Ronald wearing a metal robotic glove that pulsates steam. Rishika, holding a sniper rifle with a higher scope called Zeiss LRP. Billy holding a flamethrower that gives of the color blue, which is the most hottest degree to melt a ton of stuff. Cody, carries a large club with massive durability. And finally, Geralt carries a metallic spear as to electrocute. Geralt isn't really much of a fighter and a spear would really fit for his space.\n\nAs I stand in front of the portal itself, I asked my friends before Billy flips the switch. \"Alright everyone. This is it. This is what we've been working for 3 years. We've come a long way and now we're here to discover something impossible. Are we all ready?\"\n\n\"I'm ready when you are comrade.\" Ronald said with a smirk on his face.\n\n\"If this is really what we're going to do, then I'm counting on us.\" Geralt said with confidence in his voice.\n\n\"We're on this together.\" Cody said calmly.\n\n\"Shit. You really had to ask don't you. Of course I am idiot!\" Billy said with a mocking tone in his voice.\n\nRishika said nothing and still stares into the portal machine. We all looked at her for an answer but still she said nothing. I wanted to ask if she's bothered from something or anything. Spill out a word. Anything that'll make us stop worrying. She finally said something but only quietly. \"Ok.\"\n\n\"Alright!\" Suddenly, the machine starts to make a whistling noise as energy courses through the cords of the machine. We were shocked from the clank noise coming from the switch. I nearly jumped which instead turned my stomach from shock. \"Why Billy!\" Yelled out Ronald.\n\n\"What? We all said we're ready right?\" He was right and that made Ronald grumble.\n\nThe whistling starts to get even louder and louder that we all clasp our ears closed to avoid getting our eardrums exploded. Then suddenly a sharp noise came from the portal within. The blue light slowly glows so bright around us that we shielded our eyes from such brightness. As the light began to loosen its brightness and the sounds lowered, we lowered our hands to see the portal has started.\n\n\"This is it!\" We did it!\" Said Ronald with his eyes widened with excitement. We looked into the portal and all we can see is a blur. I know many alternatives if we go through a portal. We could disintegrate, turn to mush, or enter without any harm. I hoped that it's not the harmed one.\n\nWe wore a jacket that protects us from any radiation coming from high levels of radioactive particles. I stepped forward with a scanner in my hand, to check the radiation levels of the portal. I don't feel any radiation when the portal opened but I knew well enough to double check.\n\nAs I slowly put the antenna into the portal, the radiation level is safe to go through. This is it. We've done the impossible of traveling to the afterlife. Our questions about death will be answer. I couldn't help but smile as I look back to my friends, all amazed. \"Guys. Let's get in.\"\n\nTheir faces all full of fears but also excitement over what is yet to come. The amazing sensation of accomplishing something we've worked so hard over. \"Well, Get a move on scumbags!\"\n\nAnd so we went in and ready to explore what's out there, the great unknown, here we come.\n\nAs we come out of the portal, we were horrified. The world is like ours but the whole city is collapsed with scattered tainted blood over the walls and broken windows. The sky above is grey and thunder echoes above like a beast. There are signs of corpses. Skeletal corpses of people and creatures we've never seen before. The ground beneath us is as stone cold like snow. Dry blood stained all over around the floors of the world.\n\nThis isn't what we had expected. Something isn't right here, as if someone or some thing made this happen. We didn't expect the afterlife to be something like this. Empty with unknown origins of this world. We don't see demons or anything else.\n\nWe set our timer to  3 hour to return. Ronald had planned to close the portal in case not to let anything in. With the help of Rishika, they made an exit for us in a timer for 3 hour. The portal closed behind us and we all pulled out our equipment to take pictures and observe the world around us. Taking out a camera and a notebook from Geralt's pockets, he started taking pictures of buildings and the corpses. \"This is madness.\" Cody said in disbelief.\n\nWe started walking around to see any signs of life or any information as to what this place is. We've only went to parks, sidewalks, and broken down restaurants for about 52 mins. They look just like earth and I knew something about this place isn't the afterlife. More like a different world.\n\nWe've discovered books, devices, broken cars, even those damn sigils in the park. The sigils seems similar to satanism or paganism. This could mean that a war happened here. That doesn't mean that explains a lot. We're still finding more evidence and Cody is taking documentaries.\n\nWe started to enter into one of the buildings. Inside was much darker than what we had anticipated. Our flash lights aren't able to light so much in the building. It's as if inside the building was being plagued by darkness. Even our night goggles can't see the darkness too. This doesn't make any sense.\n\nWe stayed between the light and the tunnel of the building. We stayed only for a few minutes to discuss about how are we going to get in safely. \"The lights are pretty useless for this. I'm not even sure what this is and why it's so dark while there are still windows.\" Said Cody.\n\n\"I think we should observe more around us and find something that can help us.\" Geralt did make a really good point. We could find something that can really brighten up the tunnel of the building.\n\n\"You got good point.\" Said Ronald.\n\n\"I can just flame through the darkness. You ever thought of that? Think twice moron!\" Said Billy.\n\n\"I am not moron!\" Said Ronald.\n\n\"Guys come on! Billy, stop being so harsh on him for just 5 minutes and just do your thing.\" I think I made him shut his mouth but I know very well that isn't the reason why. He mumbles to himself as he held his flamethrower. With a pull of the trigger, the blue flames breaths out of the flamethrower. Suddenly, we hear screams from inside the dark tunnels. The flames revealed enough light for us to see a pale horrifying face. The features of the face isn't human or was once was. Its eyes are wide and the pupils are too big. It was smiling so widely, ear to ear. I don't see any teeth or anything in that mouth.\n\nI think I heard it grumble like an animal from that thing. I couldn't move or scream. I just froze in fear as chills runs all over my blood. I can't stop thinking of what it'll do to me if I had gone in the darkness. I can't see its whole body. I can only see its face in the darkness as Billy's flamethrower lights up the tunnel. Billy immediately retreated his flamethrower and started walking away slowly. \"What is that?\" Said Ronald.\n\n\"You don't wanna find out.\" Billy said as they started walking away from it except that Geralt was running away into the light.\n\nThe face began to laugh. Laugh like a maniac that made my mind shake into haunting imaginations of what is behind that face. I felt like its looking at me in the eyes. It doesn't want me to leave. I jumped when something grabbed my arm. I broke contact with it and saw that Rishika drags me away from the tunnel. We started to run. I can hear the screams from behind me getting closer. I began to panic as we kept running. I don't want to know what's beyond in the darkness. I don't hear any footsteps behind me which made my panic worse. We kept running and running until we finally got to the light and the scream stopped. I didn't want to look back but I can't help myself to look back.\n\nI turned to see the face 10 feet away from me. Its jaw was open so long and its eyes got even bigger with dark circles and wrinkles around it. It was going to eat me alive or just toying with me. It went back into the deepest of the darkness but still make contact with me.\n\nI collapsed to the ground, not realizing that I've been running carelessly of my lungs that I took large breaths. \"Stay in the light.\" Rishika said quietly. I think she's right on that one. Heck, I'd rather stay in the light than stay in that dark tunnel. But in the tunnels, it could be the answer to this world. I have to know what happened. Even if I hate it. \"We have to go back.\"\n\n\"What!? Are you insane! That thing will kill us if we go in there! If we start to wonder in that place and got lost, we're going to die!\" Never have I've once heard Billy in a panicking tone before which actually makes me worry for his sanity. Cody steps in and told Billy to calm down. Billy didn't take that really well but stood close together with us.\n\nGeralt was in a fetal position on the floor, talking so much gibberish to himself. He was trying to comfort himself with his words but it seems his mind just broke into madness.\n\nCody's eyes were wide open. I can understand that he doesn't want to believe what he'd saw and that he thought of it as a hallucination. But I know that he knew deep down that's not true. He was only lying to himself.\n\nRonald rubbed his face with his free sweating hands, not able to comprehend what he saw in the tunnels. He sat down and looked into the tunnels. His eyes turned wider and wider the more he looked into that tunnel in the building.\n\nI know very well that this isn't the end. But my whole crew was in deep fear except for Rishika. the edges of her lips curled as if she struggled to keep her emotions. She stared into the darkness with dagger with her hands bolded into fists. I don't know what's going on with her. Something about her doesn't feel right and I began to question. \"Rishika?\" I couldn't say much. I don't know what else to ask about her. She nodded me off and stared into the tunnels.\n\nI shook my head and stood back up. I grabbed Billy's flamethrower that caught his attention. \"Hey! What the hell do you think you're doing!\"\n\n\"I'm going in there. You guys stay here while I figure out what's happened here.\"\n\n\"You can't go in there alone! What happens when you die, huh?! Your jackass mind can't even think right!\"\n\n\"We have to know what's in there an I'm the one who goes! Whether you like it or not, you're staying here until I come back! Do you understand that!\" I was breathing heavily as I shouted. I've lost control over my voice that I was trembling. I want to keep them safe in the light. From that thing in the darkness. I want to know and that's what I'll do to get it.\n\n\"You got sick in the head! We're not letting you go in there!\"\n\n\"How about we go in together?\" We turned our heads to Ronald in disbelief. I thought he didn't want to go in there but he wasn't going to back down easily. He even pulled a brave expression on his face. \"Are you! Are you kidding me!? Didn't you hear me right! We're going to die in there!\"\n\n\"But we will die together. No comrade leaves comrade behind. I won't let you die alone.\"\n\n\"He-he's got a good point. I mean. I nearly shat myself but I don't want you to be alone in there either. You're our friend Darwin.\" Geralt finally gained control of his sanity. But that doesn't give as much comfort. He's still shaking and was trying to keep his body still and calm.\n\nRishika stepped between me and Billy, looking at both of us with nervous and confident eyes. Billy scoffs and was about to say his words but was interrupted by Cody's hand lay on his shoulder. \"Remember Billy. We don't leave friends behind.\"\n\nBilly groans in both annoyance and fear in his voice. He angrily took away the flamethrower from my hands and started stomping towards the tunnel. \"Alright fine! Lets go in! And if we die, I blame it on you guys!\"\n\nI looked at them and saw fear on their faces. I can't believe or understand why they would be doing this. They should be considering to stay in the light but instead they want to go with me into the dark. I don't understand about people. People are complex but that's ok. I couldn't help myself to chuckle. This is far insane than I could imagine. I think they think the same way too.\n\nWe walked in with Billy's flamethrower lighting the place around us. It's the good thing the flamethrower can light up as a lantern. We found 2 wooden torches which looks to be made by old fashioned cultists. Cody and I held them and Billy gave us flames to light up the torch, which means that Billy won't have to use so much of his fuel.\n\nWe wondered around in a large room full of fallen bricks and wood. The walls are carved in the same sigils before. I looked up to see a giant skeletal corpse that made me jump. Chills run cold as hair started to rise from my skin. Good news is that it's dead. The corpse looked like a giant arachnid with a human skeletal head. It was as if I was looking at a demon corpse or an ancient creature since dinosaurs existed. \"Guys, come check this out!\" I walked towards Geralt with a file in his hand. We all looked to see that it was a document.\n\n\"It was some sort of documentary on an experiment. Something about the void blood they found in the fossils.\"\n\n\"Fossils?\" Ronald questionably asked.\n\n\"Yeah. It's as if the fossils have a substance that mutates living organisms, sometimes.\"\n\n\"What makes you say that?\" asked Cody.\n\n\"Say what?\"\n\n\"Sometimes? Why?\"\n\n\"Well, it's alive.\"\n\n\"How can be alive?\" Ronald asks.\n\n\"The blood cells inside the void blood are sentient cells that is similar to the parasites. The difference between the parasite and the void blood is that the void blood has intelligence of its own. Which means it can take any victim or object they wish or become a form of their own at birth.\"\n\nI wonder about the face again which made me hysterical. Looking around to see nothing but darkness. From what I've heard from Geralt, I felt as if it was familiar to something I knew. \"Geralt, can you give me that?\"\n\nHe handed me the file and I started reading it with my friends. The whole documentary was english, which gave me relief. I read through them and found a key word that caught my attention. \"It can shape shift into many forms. Animals, objects, even humans. But their faces and body structure will change overtime into distorted version of humans. Sounded too much like the one we saw before.\"\n\n\"That's because it is.\" Rishika said quietly. I turned my head to see her look up into the skeletal corpse. \"What do you mean by that?\"\n\n\"That thing is one of the most dangerous specimens in this area. It toys with people and when it's done playing around it decides to turn them into their puppets. We can't see their true forms because they're all a singularity. They're a hive mind.\" I couldn't understand what she meant by that at this time. So much things unknown here and now she tells us this. I don't know how she know this and I felt like she was here before. Then, a haunting thought came into my mind. A question I've never thought I could ask. \"You're not-\"\n\nSuddenly, a loud bang of stones randomly appeared. We flashed our torches around to see where the sound came from and I heard a scream coming out of Geralt's mouth. \"RUN!! RUN!!\" He began to run into the hallway and we followed him out. We were frightened in terror from his scream and I don't need to ask why. I know what was coming and I can hear loud and fast footsteps coming towards us. Its footsteps sounded like a spiders.\n\nMy lungs couldn't keep up my breathing for oxygen but my instincts to escape from this nightmarish monster keeps my legs going. My legs started to sore but all I could think was to keep running. The screaming from behind us is getting closer. The screams are wrong. It's all wrong like a deer mixed with a man.\n\nEven if we use our weapons, we'd probably be dead already. We have no idea where and how big it is. We needed the space and to see. But we can only hold our torches and we need them to see where we're going.\n\nAhead of us was an elevator door and Geralt rapidly presses the button. Thank whoever is watching over us because the elevator opened and light shines inside. \"Quickly! get in!\" Geralt, already ahead of us, is now inside of the elevator. We put out our torches and bolted into the elevator. Suddenly, I tripped on something. Making me fall to the ground. My hammer slid at my right side. I tried to get back up but the face was already 5 feet away from me. I grabbed my hammer quickly but was swiped away by a hand. The darkness grew bigger and I can't see anything except the light behind me. The face. That horrible and terrifying face is now inches away from my face.\n\nIs this where I'll die. To die to something of the unknown. I don't know what's going to happen when I die here and I'd hoped to something, anything to give me mercy from this thing. I've heard gunshots, shooting its face but it did nothing. \"DARWIN!\" I heard Geralt scream out. I tried to push it off of me but it was too strong. Its mouth began to open so long and I can see the teeth far in its dark throat. I don't want to die to this thing. It began to laugh so loud that my ears rings in pain. I can't scream. No matter how much I tried, it presses my chest tightly that I can't. My eyes began to make tears.\n\nYou know. People sometimes describe their near death experience. Flashing memories of your past. The good and bad things. You saw yourself together with your family, having dinner on a Christmas night. Or spending time with you loved ones in one of the most amazing moments. Or even achieving your goals you so much dreamed to accomplish. That sounds both good and terrifying. But I'm not seeing any of it before my eyes. All I see is the face of the unknown.\n\n\"DARWIN!\" I've heard my friends scream out loud. Even Rishika. By the time they screamed, something pushes off the creature. It was a big punch and I can see It's human. The face flew to the left, crushing into the stone walls. My eyes couldn't see the full picture as to who had saved me. I heard a woman's voice as she drives a hit at the things face. The thing started to squirm and was trying to run away but was grabbed hold by her grip. Then, a sound that sounds like a slice. The creature screams so loud it made me cover my ears.\n\nThen a loud crush can be heard. The creature stopped screaming. I was shocked to my very core. I couldn't hear my friends because I was too fixated on the creature and the person who saved me. Now I can hear them clearly. \"Darwin! Come on lets get you out of here!\" Cody said as he drags me up into the elevator. There, as I looked back, I saw the person's face. Her left eye was wrong. Too big than her normal right eye. She doesn't look like she wants to kill me. She looked terrified. That's when I felt familiar when I looked closer at her right eye. Her pupil was sky blue and I nearly recognized it before the elevator door closes.\n\nThe elevator door closes and I finally can take breaths. The elevator is large enough for us to fit in. The first words to crack the silence was Billy. \"What was that.\"\n\n\"I don't know.\" Ronald replied.\n\nI don't know why and how I could feel something familiar about her. I've never met her in my life. I was going to die but she saved me and she was able to kill it. She could be part void which sounds like it made more sense. In the files, the voids blood can take any victim they wish. I still got the files on my hand which I didn't realize I was holding it this whole time. I started reading into the documentaries and found a few details as to what the void blood is.\n\nWhen it takes its victims, they take over the body of the victim. The victims experience horrible pain like fire that is set to 600 degrees. When it takes over their victims, they use their bodies as a costume or a puppet and deforms its body into its very liking of its own ability. They're intents are unknown and they only show signs of murder. They only seem to kill. The scientists found no answer from them. They tried to ask but nothing. Even when they began to start tests and when they do they get killed by it.\n\nThe voids blood makes the victim super human strength, faster speed, high durability, and reality manipulation. They can also form into other different kinds of weaponry to butcher and can form their physical features. Their faces are different in variety. The pale face is the weakest of them all since they only can stay in dark places. The ones with only their teeth and eyes are visible are stronger and has many advantages. It can use a human body or an animal as a disguise to walk around in the light and they can't go out without it. The most strongest, it has not been given so much of words except frantic writing and a picture of a shadowy figure with a one very realistic eye. It only said that it's the disciples of the void all over the page with some blood.\n\nThere is one sentence that bothers me the most and what It said is this in blood.\n\n**The void is the unknown. I've seen what lies in there. Death is freedom.**\n\n\"Guys. I think we're trapped in this world.\" Cody caught my attention. His words made me shocked as chills are poured down on me. \"What?\"\n\nHe looked at us, then looked to his stop watch. We all looked at our stopwatch. When I looked at it, I was petrified. It was over 3 hours already. We're trapped in here.\n\n\"OH SHIT! We're going to die here!\" Billy yelled out as the fear spreads around us like bushes. We have no idea how to get back home. The project I so designed for years of finding life after death was futile and I have led my friends to die in this world full of horrifying creatures.\n\nWe stayed in that elevator for what seems to be an hour. It's good enough that we can move around in here. Whoever designed this kind of elevator must be a gentlemen for providing space.\n\nI felt so so tired that I just lay there helplessly. Our weapons are no use against them. No matter how much we tried.\n\nGeralt kept rocking back and forth and sobbing so much. He was so kind and supportive but now he's not in a mood for himself. He's losing himself and I can't help but blame myself for pulling them into this world.\n\nCody, sat next to me with an empty expression on his face. He looked more pale than before like he'd seen a ghost. Of course, he saw the face. I don't see any movement from him.\n\nI stared up and started questioning myself. *Is this what I've been looking for? Was it worth it?* No. It wasn't.\n\n\"Guys. I wanna say something before we die in this shit hole.\" Billy sounded surprisingly soothing which caught our attention. He was preparing something to tell us but was interrupted by Ronald. \"Alright. Spit your bullshit rational words on us Billy.\"\n\nBilly's face turned red as his anger burns inside his body. \"OH SHUT UP YOU BOULDER PUNCHING ASSHOLE!!\"\n\n\"WATCH YOUR MOUTH LITTLE MAN!!\"\n\n\"YOU THINK I'M GOING TO SAY THOSE THINGS RIGHT NOW! WHY IS YOUR DAMN HEAD SO FUCKING SMALL!! WE ARE ABOUT TO DIE AND THERE IS NO WAY HOME!! OUR WEAPONS ARE FUCKING USELESS HERE AND WE'VE WORKED ON THIS PROJECT FOR NOTHING BUT DEATH!!\"\n\n\"YOU TREAT US LIKE ABSOLUTE GARBAGE RIGHT AT THE BEGINNING!! STOP BLAMING ON US ON EVERYTHING WE DIDN'T DO!! AND YOU'RE JUST LIKE THAT OF AN ASSHOLE!! YOU KEPT GOING ON AND ON ABOUT YOU BEING THE BEST DOCTOR!! WHO ARE YOU NOW!! YOU ARE THE WORST DOCTOR!!\n\n\"YOU BLOODY MOTHERFUCKER!!\"\n\n\"SHUT UP!!\" We were all caught by surprise when Rishika just yelled at them. This is the first time we ever heard her yell. She was so quiet but now she was so distressed and tears rapidly come down beneath her eyes. \"Just shut up already. Is this really what we're going to turn into before we die here? We're all losing the hope we carry and you're just arguing right now. This is not the moment we wanted before death. So please just stop it!\" Her sobbing was so brutally depressing that I even began to cry too.\n\nI've put them in a place of horrific nightmares that we can't survive. It's all my fault. To give them hopes and faith in such a false concept. I was wrong about everything. I never get the chance to say goodbye to my parents or even my best friend. Here, I sat just crying. I think they hate me for this. I know it. How would you feel if you've been carried into a mess you've believed so much in by that one person that tells you it's like heaven? You'd probably hate him too for that.\n\nI'm going to stop here now. I'm tired. I've been writing this note book for who knows what. The elevator keeps going up and up and up. I don't know how long am I going to live in here. If you find this notebook. please. Tell the others of my story. If I still live, I don't know. Let's see how it goes. Something is knocking on the elevator door.\n\n[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13u08eb/theres_a_universe_where_earth_is_filled_with/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)",
