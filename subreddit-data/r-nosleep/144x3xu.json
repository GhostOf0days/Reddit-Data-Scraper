    "postText": "Throughout my life I have had tons of what I would say paranormal encounters from camping in haunted areas in the smokies to terrible dreams where I would wake up stuck and can't move but the worst place I had been to in which was uneasy would have been the house from when I was a boy. Just for some context, it is located around pasportank County, nc. This house was odd my parents bought it from a elderly couple and they didn't know what they were in for, it was a fixerupper  and close to my grandparents so it was what they wanted and they knew the history a little bit but nothing was off with it so they bought it. But from what me and my siblings remember the house was terrifying, you woke up all throughout the night breathing heavily like something sucked you breath away, you would hear running down the stairs,hitting on the walls, random doors slamming with no breeze whatsoever and items falling randomly e.t.c but the one who experienced most of the wierd stuff was me. \n\nEvery single night in that house I would dream of something peculiar which could just be crossed off as just childhood nightmare but still freaks me out to this day I would dream of some mix or human/animal slowly murdering my entire family and making me watch, now it would kind of be a little better if I knew what these methods they were using to be slaughtered I'm my dreams were but I didn't know about anything like that much later in life but the one thing I remembered was their favorite object to use , the beats, was a gainy looking bread knife in which he would chip them limb from limb and I could still see the smile on their face as they were doing it and they would slowly lick the blood of in front of my face and I could see their eyes, instead of white on the outside it was this disgusting tint of yellow and the color on the middle was a very deep yellow. They would breathe heavily and just stare nothing else. After these events, they would just stare for what felt like hours until finally they would harm me. I could feel every thing they did to me exactly like what they did to my family in thses dreams and then I would wake up with my heart beating out of My chest and would be so terrified that I couldn't even move because the sounds I meantoned before would be elevated I could here knocking and scratching and everything would happen all at once surprisingly what is happening as I'm writing this it all feels like it's coming back and I'm terrified. \n\nGoing back to the story after waking up like this, I would have bruises wherever I had been hurt in the dream come up within the days. And sometimes they wouldn't happen, but on some occasions they did, and it would terrify me. And my parents were also just as confused as i was because I would come down in the morning or late at night if I had the confidence and they would see me freaking out terribly to the point I'm shaking and crying. And for some reason, it all changed. They dimmed down we would still here all the stuff but it was more mellow like it was just an inconvience to us\n\n 3 to 4 years later it happened again about a month before we moved out of that house to the area we found in the smokies they all came back but like a tsunami.  We would hear all these things happen all throughout the day, and my dreams came back to me but in worse versions, to which all I remember was shaking. And from the other accounts, we were all ready to leave and so the buyer moved in, and we left. On the ride up to the smokies my heart hurt in a way or being unsettled  right until one point of the car ride where their was a breath of fresh air in which we were 3 minutes away from the house I felt mellow and safe for the first time in a while from that house and that's when my story end about one of the first haunted memories that I can remember of that house. \n\njust for the  kindov proving their was something wrong with that house growing up we never had people stay because the kids would start crying due to the unsettling presence their and the next buyers kids refused to live in the upstairs and ended up staying all together in the living room or the or the master bedroom on the first floor and eventually they even left.along with this im sitting with my twin sister talking the things that happend. To tell you what happened to the house last time me and my father and I checked, and someone rerenovated the place and got recently sold. And to those people, I hope everything went away, but I have a feeling their feeling the exact thing we felt.",
