By no means was he an equal in comparison to the popularity of Stephen King or Dean Koontz but there was something special about his works. If you happened to stumble across one of his stories they had a habit of sticking around and festering like little rotten delicacies within your mind.\n\nFor years as a growing adult I sat down and studied every word of his. I tried to mimic the way he wrote and every time I\u2019d fall short. There was something inside of me that just couldn\u2019t match the integrity of his tales. Every story he wove sounded drastic, real, as if the main characters were screaming out for their stories to be heard in hopes they didn\u2019t fade away into eternity.\n\nHe didn\u2019t just make the characters come alive, he made them tangible. The reader felt as though the characters themselves were only a pages flip away.\n\nMaybe that\u2019s what made his horror so powerful. It wasn\u2019t just the people you felt you could turn too, but also the creatures, the villains, the things that couldn\u2019t be described by anyone else except by Vincent Valentine himself.\n\nI ended up writing a brief paper and submitting it to a contest wrapped around the idea of \u2018who inspired you to write?\u2019 I can\u2019t say I won by any means but every paper was openly displayed on the internet for anyone to read and comment.\n\nImagine my surprise when I received a comment from one 'Vincent Valentine' exclaiming only a few words;\n\n\u2018You\u2019ve warmed my heart. Keep a lookout in your inbox.\n\nWith much appreciation,\n\nVincent Valentine.\u2019\n\nI remember the sinking feeling in my heart as I read his comment. I felt blessed by a man so above my stature that it made me feel spotlighted in oddest, best and worst type of way. Nearly every hour on the hour I\u2019d do a quick log in and hope to see the little message icon highlighted in the upper right hand corner of my screen.\n\nThis went on for a week. Precisely 7 days later on the hour of his comment I got a notification that someone had sent me a message.\n\n\u2018109 Woodcrest Rd. Portland, ME? I feel confident in my sources. Expect a package soon.\n\nWith elation,\n\nVincent Valentine. \u2019\n\nHe had found my address. \n\nTo say I was surprised wouldn\u2019t sum up my feelings in the least. I felt no hostility or fear however, it was almost Wonka-esque. I felt like I was getting a golden ticket and that feeling wasn\u2019t misplaced. Another 7 days later I woke up to find a package waiting at my door.\n\nI stared down at it for a minute, a black fabric shroud was tightly wound around a wooden box. My address was stamped in red lettering over the thick velvety veil. Next to it lay the words \u2018From: Vincent Valentine.\u2019\n\nI reached down letting my hands grasp around the extravagant box. With a gentle tug I raised it off of the ground. The concrete seemed so boring and mundane compared to the package. I almost felt ashamed that I had let it sit there even for just a moment. \n\nWith a quick spin I turned around, slammed my door shut and proceeded over to my kitchen table. I tried to find the seams of the dark fabric, tugging along the edges but to my surprise found none.\n\nFrom here it took me a moment to comprehend how I was going to open it without damaging the pristine void like cover. With some trepidation I wandered over to my storage closet and pulled out a box cutter. I hated the fact I had to ruin such an interesting presentation but I knew there was no other way.\n\nI pressed the tip of the blade to the fabric and slowly slid it down. As the fabric retreated it split open revealing a red swirly underside clearly influenced by the colors of flowing blood. \n\nMy lips twitched upward before a small laugh left my lips. I stared at the display in front of me. I had cut the fabric from one corner to the other and it had perfectly spread and curled back like a body under autopsy. The wooden box itself lay under the skin ready to dissected from its body.\n\nI set my box cutters aside and pulled out the wooden chest. Intricate designs were carved into the paneling and I instantly recognized them from how Vincent described them in his books. I was looking at Avestan text. They were so beautifully drastic from our modern characters and alphabets.\n\nA chill ran up my spine as I thought back to the horrors Vincent had described in his tales. His greatest theme was studying the dangers of the oldest knowledge available in the world. The spreading of unnatural knowledge was ever present in his works. Granted I couldn\u2019t read the carvings I still appreciated the showmanship.\n\n I had never in my life thought I\u2019d ever be brought a gift like this from someone I admired as much as Mr. Valentine.\n\nI felt the indents of the box as my fingers trailed up to the lid. The wood seemed cold as if it had been left in some winters cavern overnight yet it was a midsummer's day and the sun was blazing outside of my front door. With a quick flick upwards I removed the casing and peered at the contents inside.\n\nThe innards of the box contained a black leather bound journal and next to it an envelope stamped with the symbol that appeared in every one of Valentines stories, the mark of Aka Manah. The forgotten God of magic and suffering.\n\nI pulled the envelope out first, letting it rest in one hand while my other hand blindly felt around the table for the box cutters. With a quick nudge I felt a light sting. My eyes tore away from the folded letter and to the razor on my table. With blind stupidity I had skimmed my skin across the blade slicing my fingertip open. I let out a huff of disappointment in myself before gripping the handle and pulling it upwards towards the stamp.\n\nVery gingerly I rocked the razors edge around the bottom of the wax seal, hoping to keep it in one piece. Oddly enough the wax seemed incredibly durable. Even after a couple of flawed jabs it held up nicely. The lip of the envelope separated exposing parchment inside.\n\nI could feel the shivers creep up my spine and crossing over to my neck. Something was so foreboding about this whole situation and I loved every second of it. At the time I felt like I was in the definition of a horror novel.\n\nI carefully pulled the parchment out from its resting place and began reading the handwritten note.\n\n\u2018I hope you\u2019ve enjoyed the extravagant show I\u2019ve so far prepared for you. There is so much more to come. Inside this very special case that I\u2019ve provided you resides a bound journal. I couldn\u2019t help but notice the limitations to your short stories. Though I loved every single one, I must say, I found something missing. I wouldn\u2019t worry though. I want to help.\n\nFurther in this envelope are plane tickets. I want you to visit my home for seven simple nights. By the time you leave I can promise you that little black book will be filled with your first ever living, breathing tale.\n\nAll you have to do is make the plane journey and I\u2019ll take care of the rest. Make sure to sign the front cover of your new book. It\u2019s special after all and it\u2019s all yours.\n\nWith respects,\n\nVincent Valentine.\u2019\n\nI slowly lowered the letter on the table, careful to avoid spilling any droplets of blood onto the page. I could feel the indent of the tickets still in the envelope. I couldn\u2019t believe my luck. I\u2019d say my heart sang but once again something crept its way in me, something dark. It felt like I was being invited to a gala that I didn\u2019t belong at. \n\nI was simply a dwarf standing amongst giants.\n\nI shook the feeling off and reached into the box to retrieve my new journal.\n\nEach page was blank and crisp, hundreds of pages ready to be filled. When the flickering of pages reached the front cover I noticed something. A simple black line. A perfect place for my signature.\n\nWith a tepid sense of giddiness I raced back to my storage area and retrieved a pen. I quickly returned to my book and spread it open wide. With one hand I held the pages spread and with the other I held the pen. I swept my signature boldly across the line, and just as my pen tip left the page, a single droplet of blood pierced down on top of the paper. \n\nA final period at the end of my name.\n\nThe irony of this wasn\u2019t lost to me. I laughed trying to offset the feeling of unease. Signing that book shifted something in my life that I wouldn't be prepared for. I no longer felt like I didn\u2019t just belong near the giants. I felt like they now were aware of me. They were watching me, judging me.\n\nThe tickets that lay inside the newly opened envelope were scheduled for 7 months out. I knew these dates weren\u2019t by coincidence. Vincent wanted these sevens to appear, for what reason? I couldn\u2019t say. I figured more of his showmanship would explain it to me in due time.\n\nSo I cleared my schedule for a while and prepped for my departure.\n\nWhen the date came I took a taxi from my home towards the airport. The sky was darkened and cloudy. I watched as lightning flashed in the distance within the heavy gray clouds. \n\nThe sky seemed so high up that day. A true monolith of creations might. I could almost feel something immensely powerful looking down upon me from within that storm. It's eyes were assuredly turned down upon me and the journey that lay ahead.\n\nIn contrast, the airport itself felt as clinical as always. The typical smell of coffee mixed in with the incoming rain blended together into a mesmerizing fragrance. I grabbed a cup for myself and pressed it against my lips. I let the aroma fill my nostrils as I took in the sights of the planes docking and departing.\n\nWhen the time came for me to board, lightning struck the tarmac. A mix of asphalt and gravel exploded near our plane. Several passengers screamed out in fear. The explosion sent pellets of rocks into the metallic frame of our sanctuary.\n\nOf course the plane was decommissioned for the day. All planes in the area were tarmacked until further notice. I felt my shoulders give way to disappointment. Vincent said all I had to do was board the plane and he\u2019d take care of the rest. Due to the fates I couldn\u2019t even manage that much.\n\nI took a seat over at the departure area and began my wait. It took the storm 7 hours to depart the area and free up the skies for travel. I had nearly given up on the trip when I heard the intercom sound from overhead.\n\n\u201cAll flights are now boarding.\u201d\n\nI looked around me and noticed only a handful of us had survived the stay. The rest had all left. No doubt distraught over their failed plans. Us few who remained had boarded with ease. Almost like a miracle, the rest of the journey went smoothly. We traveled hours before the sun began setting and we arrived at our destination briskly at dusk.\n\nUpon exiting the plane we all headed towards the luggage area. Much to my surprise I was intercepted just meters away by a handsome clean cut man dressed up in an all black suit and wearing a chauffeur\u2019s cap.\n\n\u201cExcuse me Madam, I believe I\u2019m here for you.\u201d The Gentleman said, his dark brown eyes squinting at me with remarkable elegance.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, who are you?\u201d I politely questioned. I couldn\u2019t have imagined that my ride would have waited for me after a seven hour delay. I was already prepared to gouge my own pockets to hire a taxi service to Mr. Valentine\u2019s home.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in service to Mr. Vincent Valentine. I believe that I\u2019m to take you to his residence.\u201d His voice was so soothing and smooth. He seemed like more of an actor playing in a role than a real services employee.\n\n\u201cIn that case, I\u2019m sorry I made you wait.\u201d I turned my eyes to the bags next to him. He had already procured my luggage.\n\n\u201cOh, don't worry about that Madam. I haven\u2019t been waiting long. This is the precise time I was told to arrive and so I did. Now if you wouldn\u2019t mind, Mr. Valentine would like to see you as soon as possible.\u201d He flashed me a smile, his pearly teeth were perfectly aligned and accentuated his chiseled jaw.\n\nWithout much more conversing he led me to the back of the small parking garage. With a slight nod he guided me over to a black 1964 Dodge 330. It looked ravishingly untouched despite its old age.\n\nMy personable Valet walked over to the passenger\u2019s side door and opened it for me. I went to collect my belongings from him but he stopped me. He let me know he\u2019d take care of my bags. I thanked him and took my seat. The interior of the vehicle reflected much of the same feel that it had projected on the exterior. That this was somehow a brand new classic.\n\nWhen my Chauffeur returned to his side of the vehicle and shut his door I felt myself jump. I was once more jostled into feeling out of place. I had wished that I could have brought some company with me. Someone to be within my same social class. Instead I was resorted to simply just being a fish out of water in the lap of dark luxury.\n\nWithout another word and only a glimpse of a quick smile from my companion, we headed off.\n\nI was surprised by the terrain we had found ourselves in just minutes after leaving the airport. The businesses and shopping centers had given away to grasslands and forests. The trees at first came one by one, then by clusters and then finally they tunneled us in. There was merely a thin road with a wall of lumber on either end of us.\n\nYet still, I was immersed in the landscape. My eyes jumped from one thing to another. The hoot of an owl, the chirping of crickets, it all amazed me. It was as if I was a new born baby entering the world for the first time. The face of my traveling partner remained nonetheless unimpressed. His demeanor made it clear that this journey was nothing special to him. And I suppose it wasn't.\n\nAs the darkness outside had peaked, refraining me from any sort of sightseeing, the man next to me spoke up.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re here, Madam.\u201d He spun the wheel of the car instinctively and circled into a large rounded driveway. I looked out my window and saw a large stone manor cropped up in chiseled Gothic architecture. Gray brickwork textured and meshed brilliantly with darkened oaken doors and rich window frames.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll get your bags. Please, head up to the door. Mr. Valentine is waiting for you.\u201d\n\nI nodded and thanked my driver who waved away my thanks in a polite manner.\n\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t thank me. I\u2019m just doing what my contract outlines.\u201d With one final charming smile he exited the vehicle. I soon followed\n\nThe size of the manor astounded me. Vincent was an amazingly talented author but I knew most readers had no idea who he was. How he could afford to live in a Victorian palace like this was unexplainable to me.\n\nWith heavy lead lining my heels I made my ascent up the stone patio steps towards the large wooden door. Hidden amongst the frame of the giant gate was a wicket door. As my feet reached the final step I felt myself freeze up. The way the manor had towered over me made me feel inexplicably small and meaningless. It had left me intimidated beyond movement.\n\n\u201cWell, go on Madam. You've made it this far.\u201d The driver called out to me in a gingerly tone. He was preparing my luggage for travel. With trembling hands I knocked on the thick oaken door. A muffled impact sounded with every strike. A few moments passed by before the wicket creaked open. Inside was a beautiful young woman dressed in a black service outfit, much like the driver wore behind me.\n\nWith nothing more than a glance from her piercing eyes she spoke up.\n\n\u201cWelcome to the Wordsmith Manor Ms. Williams. Please come in.\u201d The fair skinned lady reflected the same charm all of Vincent\u2019s employees seemed to have. Though her tone was much sharper and direct. I admired her long black hair that had been pulled back into a tight bun. The dark color resonated brilliantly with her freckles and icy blue eyes.\n\n\u201cThank you.\u201d I quietly muttered. I kept my eyes low to the ground. I was scared of further intimidation from this home or its perfect occupants. I felt a finger lightly tap the underside of my chin and I looked up to see the Maid smiling at me with an unexpectedly soft smile.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be scared to look around. Mr. Valentine specifically asked us to allow you to get a grasp of all you could on your way up to him.\u201d After a quick meeting of our eyes I finally let my gaze roam. Inside was just as immaculate as the outside. Stone lined the walls with finely finished wooden flooring.\n\nThe dim lighting that flickered around us seemed to emanate on its own. I saw no signs of lights or cords connecting to any outlet, nor any outlets in general. I felt as though I had stepped back in time. Endlessly long hallways stretched out in every direction from the foyer. It struck my imagination immediately as it quite literally looked like an intricate spiders web.\n\nAs I was taking in the sights of the Wordsmith Manor, the male servant scooted past my back in a hurry. He was carrying my luggage up a nearby staircase.\n\n\u201cYour room will be located just upstairs in the main guest room. Your bags will be there for you to unpack. Though you'll find everything you need already located in the room should you search for it. For now Mr. Valentine would like to meet with you.\u201d With a light footed twirl she began walking in front of me. I toed just behind her.\n\nWe went through a nicely ornamented hallway of different paintings. Each art piece seemed to be of different creatures and characters that could only be found in the multitude of books Vincent had written. They were painted just as vividly as the author had described them as. They felt like windows into another world rather than paint on parchment.\n\nAs I gawked upwards at the portraits of all of the characters that had enraptured my mind over the years, I had scarcely noticed the change in lighting. A rose coloring had begun filling the hallway spilling outwards from a nearby threshold. It lent the way to warmth and a calming sensation. With a few more steps towards the wave of soothing light we entered Mr. Valentine\u2019s Den.\n\nMany books and tomes lined the walls of this area in a neat fashion. Not a singly speck of dust prevented the shimmering of polished wood from glowing in the light. A large red rug swirled with golds and blacks. It lay at the center of the room. Sitting right next to a large stone fireplace\n\nwas the man I had only seen on the back covers of my favorite books, Mr. Vincent Valentine. Above him a large portrait of a hellish landscape. The placard read 'The Face of Aka Manah.'\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s ready for you Sir.\u201d The woman chirped up. Vincent\u2019s eyes fluttered to life as he looked to her than over to me.\n\n\u201cThank you my dear. And also, of course, thank you Ms. Williams for coming.\u201d His eyes shined unnaturally well with an endless depth of knowledge and experience. The red tint of the room had darkened his irises to a near pitch black coloring.\n\n\u201cMr. Valentine, thank you so much for doing all of this.\u201d I nearly stumbled over my words but managed to choke them out. Vincent merely gave me a half smile and shook his head dismissively.\n\n\u201cNonsense. I saw that article you wrote about how my stories. About how they had inspired you to take up the pen and try your hand at crafting your own tales. I was beyond flattered.\u201d He motioned his slender finger over to a blood red leather wingback chair that sat next to him. With a nod I followed his directions. With a short walk closer to the Author I had taken my seat in the form fitted throne next to my life long hero.\n\n\u201cIt really is a shame how many people don\u2019t know about you.\u201d I offered as a sincere sentiment. His half smile spread slightly more across his aged and wizened face.\n\n\u201cMy work finds precisely the people I want it too. You can\u2019t share true horror with just anyone you know. I think some Authors found that out the hard way.\u201d With a soft chuckle he resumed, \u201cbut this isn\u2019t just a pleasant trip, as you must\u2019ve gathered from my letter. This is a gift. I want to tutor you for for however long it takes until you can find your voice. I can promise, no matter how heavy and large that black book you hold feels, it\u2019ll fill as easily as any ink to paper with the right motivation.\u201d\n\nWith one of his ancient hands he pointed over to my jacket pocket, exactly where I had kept my little black book. How he knew where it was still remains a mystery to me.\n\n\u201cI would love to learn from you if I could get the chance.\u201d I held back a yearning look. I didn\u2019t want to make this man think lowly of me.\n\nWith a quick check of his watch his face had grown long and disappointed.\n\n\u201cThe nights fading well past dawn and I fear our time tonight must be cut short. That being said I want you to understand one thing before bed. Each and every story you tell is as real as flesh and blood. Maybe not to you but to someone, something, somewhere. The cosmos is large and beyond that even larger. Science is just starting to scratch into what philosophers have known from the beginning of time. Sadly humanity's science will never catch up to their freedom of thought. The human understanding will always be a blip of the whole until it\u2019s wiped out completely.\u201d \n\nThe way he was staring into my eyes told me so much about who this man was. Whether or not he was sane may have been up to a debate to everyone but himself. He knew he lived in a reality so much more vivid than our own.\n\n\u201cExcuse me sir, the guest bedroom has been prepared. We have seven minutes.\u201d A feminine voice behind me had broken me from my trance. Mr. Valentine's gaze left my own and looked towards his servant.\n\n\u201cAnd so ends my lesson for the night. Dream about what I taught you and I can promise by the morning you\u2019ll already be one step closer to a new well of horror. Possibly by tomorrow night you'll be completely submerged.\u201d\n\nBefore I could respond, the Maid had ushered me out of the den. We had arrived back in the hallway of portraits. The faces amongst them had seemingly changed their gazes to match my mood. Their eyes now were cast down upon me, judging me for who I was and who I wanted to be. Once again I felt that feeling of foreboding darkness. This time however I looked the Demons back in their countless eyes. I was trying to see them as real entities just as Mr. Valentine had requested that I do. Their terrible gazes seemed to soften with every step I took. Their lips seemingly upturning at the edges of their mouths in just the slightest of manners.\n\nOnce we hit the staircase in the main foyer I chanced a glance down an adjacent hallway to see the elegant servant carrying thick iron chains from one room to the next. After quickly shutting the doors behind him he used the irons to bar them from the outside. He glanced over towards me and our eyes met. He nodded at me in acknowledgment. His face seemed paled and worn.\n\nMy guide nudged my arm to grab my attention away from the man. \"Hurry now, we need to get you in bed soon.\" With a hurried but dignified saunter she had led me up the wooden staircase and into the abyss above. Just as the den had tinted the air red, the second floor cast shadows of darkness around every corner. I felt a cold breath of wind run through me that seemed to emanate from the Manor's stone brick walls themselves.\n\n\u201cMy apologies for any drafts up here. It\u2019s been a very long time since anyone has been a guest in the Wordsmith.\u201d Her voice reflected an apologetic tone but also that of stoicism, as if she was repeating an archaic sentiment from her memories but still a sentiment nonetheless.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine, I enjoy cold air as long as there's a nice warm blanket to accompany it.\u201d I forced a smile and looked at the side of the servants face. She seemed to have a coy expression on her lips at my fleeting justification for a drafty home.\n\n\u201cAnd here it is, right at the top of the staircase. I hope you find everything to your liking. If not we\u2019ll do our best to please you in the morning.\u201d She turned to face me. Her eyes emanated light in the darkened corridor. They were submissive but penetrative, an odd combination but one gained from countless years of servitude.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure I will. Thank you.\u201d With a nod she stepped beside the door, allowing me entry past her. I walked in front of the Maid and pressed my small hand on the brass handle of the guestroom door. A quick tug and a push allowed me entry.\n\nI gaped at my room.\n\nA large queen sized bed lay mid-way between the doorway and the far wall. A veiled rose colored canopy adorned the edges of the bed mimicking Victorian royalty. The posh blankets seemed soft enough to resemble that of ruby red a cloud. I had never seen anything like it with my own eyes before.\n\nAn expansive window lay on the farthest wall, moonlight pooled into the room and coated my resting place with a beam of heavenly light. Just below the window resided a writing desk and a chair, neatly tucked in. No signs of dust or unkempt follies showed any sort of face in this pristine room.\n\nWith hushed footsteps I approached my bed. The door latching shut behind me. I allowed my hands to slowly draw back the drapes, the silk nearly slipping through my fingertips. I took a deep breath and laid down. The bed gave way underneath my body and devoured me into its encasing folds. I let out an exhausted breath as I smiled and stared up at the ceiling. I couldn\u2019t possibly have felt more excitement and desire for the future. My heart had swelled up inside of my chest at that moment.\n\nWith little more notice my eyes pushed themselves shut and filled my mind with an empty darkness. Neither dream nor thought seemed to come to me that night. My weary brain needed a rest perhaps more than I knew.\n\nI woke up hours later to the brilliant shine of the morning\u2019s sun. Even through my wispy half taut curtains the sunlight had managed to breach into my room. The large window had fully replaced the moonlight from the night prior. I looked down at myself and sighed. I had fallen asleep with all my clothes on including my shoes. I felt as though I had somehow once again proven that I didn\u2019t belong within the halls of the manor.\n\nI pushed that negative thought out of my mind. Quickly followed by physically pushing myself out of my resting place. With all the clarity of an early bird, I let my eyes travel around the naturally well-lit room. I saw a small door on the wall nearest the foot of my bed.\n\nShortly after I saw my luggage neatly placed near a hardy looking writing desk. After a quick post slumber stretch I allowed myself to start the process of unpacking my belongings. I quickly discovered that the door nearest to the bed led to a bathroom. With travel pack in hand I entered.\n\nMarble countertops and glistening silver accessories lined the bathroom. A smile broke through my face as I saw how disheveled I looked in the mirror in comparison to the pristine nature of the room I was in. I walked to the counter and unzipped my baggie. \n\nTo my surprise everything I could need was already placed neatly in a row. Toothpaste, shampoo, deodorant and even other more personal items. Strangely enough they were all my favorite brands.\n\nI shook it off and convinced myself that I just had good tastes in products.\n\nI took some extra time with getting myself cleaned up and presentable. I was fully prepared to make a good impression on my host. Hell, at that point in time, I just wanted to keep pace with his Servants.\n\nOnce I was freshened up I put my used clothes into a linen hamper and headed out towards the bedroom door. With a quick flick of my wrist I felt unexpected resistance. I tried again to meet the same result.\n\nIt was latched shut.\n\nI kept trying but sure enough the door was locked up tight from the outside of the room. A slight panic began to fill my chest. A panic set in by the fast realization I had allowed myself to enter a strangers home without proper precautions. \n\nI felt my heartbeat begin to race. \n\nWith a heavy fist I pounded on the thick wooden frame of the door. Not too long after I heard heavy footsteps glide up the staircase to the other side of my room. With the sound of a lock turning the door opened. Standing on the other side was the Butler, my former Chauffeur.\n\n\"My apologies Madam. It's been so long since we've had a guest I suppose it slipped our mind that this door would need unlocking.\" He tried to give me a charming smile but I wasn't going for it this time. I quickly spat a retort back towards him.\n\n\"Why was my door locked in the first place?\" I questioned, my eyes shooting directly into the brown depths of his.\n\n\"It's mostly to keep the night staff out. They don't like to be bothered much and can be a bit of a handful if they bump into anyone they don't know.\" In retaliation to my stare his eyes had softened and melted down some of my guard.\n\n\"Well I don't care about that. I don't want my door locked. Don't do that in the future.\" The man grimaced and nodded.\n\n\"As you wish.\" He stated flatly. \"Now If you wouldn\u2019t mind breakfast is about to be prepared. If you head to the dining room I\u2019m sure Mr. Valentine will meet you there.\u201d With that the man headed back down the steps towards the foyer. I stood still. I was at a loss as to where to venture. I decided to follow him and venture down the steps. By the time I reached the bottom the man was gone.\n\n\"You can head straight down towards the Den but make the first right in the hallway.\" I jumped as the female voice spoke up right behind my back. I turned around to see the maid behind me. She gave a calm nod and waved out her hand, pointing down the direction of the hall.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, thank you.\u201d I whispered. It was slowly becoming clear to me that there was something lurking just below the surface of this manor, like it was all a part of some type of show.\n\nWith that in the back of my mind I headed off down the hallway. The stone began to lighten up towards the back as a large windowpane took over an entire wall. I entered the windowed room and saw a rather extravagant dining set. Two chairs presented themselves at the foot of either end of the table.\n\nI chose the chair that seemed reserved for a guest, the one less commanding of the dining room. Before long a sensual smell filled the room. Freshly baked bread, bacon and eggs were all seemingly being made from scratch. I stared outside the window as I waited and saw a large clearing in the woods. A bench lay outside facing the yard while several rocky outcroppings lay at the far end, just out of my sight.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful day isn\u2019t it?\u201d A smooth voice trailed off. I had glanced at the doorway to see the tall slender figure of Mr. Vincent Valentine. A new blazer was draped over his body accentuating his strong but thin shoulders.\n\n\u201cVery beautiful Sir.\u201d I said, smiling at him. He put out his hand and waved my pleasantries away.\n\n\u201cNo need for that. I need you independent for teaching, otherwise you\u2019ll just end up like me.\u201d His tone was like silk. He knew how to speak. Without another word he took his seat at the other end of the table. Fresh plates of food were brought out by the servants and placed in front of us. Just as I had imagined they had prepared fresh biscuits, bacon and eggs along with finely toasted bread.\n\nI raised some food to my mouth and took a bite, nothing but purity of flavor could explain the taste. It was so very refined. It was prepared in such a way that I had to believe that the chauffeur didn\u2019t just have a knack for driving under his belt but was a perfected chef as well.\n\nMr. Valentine gazed out of the window as I ate, not touching a bite of the spread that lay in front of him.\n\n\u201cAre you willing to go beyond your personal comfort to write?\u201d He asked out loud. The surprising nature of his question made me put my food back down on my plate.\n\n\u201cAs long as I\u2019m being taught by you, I don\u2019t think we could go wrong.\u201d I offered while I eyed up the strange teacher.\n\nAt my words his sharp gaze shifted to my eyes, penetrating my very soul.\n\n\u201cI want you to leave here a creator, an author of the highest ability. That takes a great deal of sacrifice. Would you be willing to do that?\u201d\n\nI felt stunned at his question. I didn\u2019t understand his meaning nor his goal.\n\n\u201cI believe I am.\u201d I replied. I looked on his face for any type of signal that I had said the right thing. To my surprise a smile came across the old man\u2019s face.\n\n\u201cGood to hear. Tonight will be a fine night for horror.\u201d With that Mr. Valentine stood up from his chair and walked out of the dining room, leaving myself and the feast before me, to our own devices.\n\nI took my time to fill my stomach and then excused myself silently from the table. I wandered the halls of the Wordsmith endlessly. The layout seemingly to continuously shift with every loop. I couldn't explain it but my thought's seemed to refuse to be collected.\n\nI had based by two equivalent foyers, three libraries and countless halls. Eventually becoming lost in the maze of the manor. I felt a cold sweat begin to hit me as I was quickly realizing I wouldn't be able to get back to where I started.\n\nSomehow every long hour only lasted a short minute. The windows began to shift from morning light, to brilliant afternoon beams to a rose colored sunset in just moments.\n\nI spent all day lost and didn't speak with Mr. Valentine a single time after breakfast. No doubt frustrating the man that I was wasting his time.\n\nI quickened my pace down the stone hallways. Left, Right, Left, Forward. Somehow I looped around. I began to jog. Night was approaching. The layout was impossible. Where were the servants?\n\nI heard whispers coming from doors that had long since been chained shut. The same chains I had seen the Butler the night prior carrying. Could this be some ploy just to scare me? If so how were they commanding these stone spaces to loop and twirl so easily around me.\n\nIt didn't matter eventually. Night had fully fallen by the time I found myself at the Foyer near my bedroom. Even though hours supposedly had past my stomach was still full from breakfast.\n\nI felt like crying. I wasted an entire day of my trip running around a manor by myself. Not a single page written in the journal Mr. Valentine had bought for me. And to make it worse a quick glance around the hallways showed no signs of life. Just cold drafts of dry air. I had no option but to go back up to my room and try to start anew tomorrow.\n\nI traced my steps back up from the night prior and making it back up to my room. Inside was dark, clouds had covered the moonlight letting nothing break through the thick ink that had pooled inside. I kicked off my shoes and fell back onto the bed. Tears in my eyes.\n\nWith every huff of air I took I could hear an echo coming from the blackened corner of the room.\n\nI turned my head and stared into the void.\n\nI couldn't make out anything at first. I wiped the water from my eyes and kept focusing. Eventually a figure formed in my mind. Something just taller than myself. Masculine, dapper.\n\nThe Male Servant.\n\nI sat up and called out to the shadow. \"What are you doing in my room? How long have you been there?\"\n\nThe mans outline just continued to watch me. My senses suddenly kicked in. Some sort of instinct was telling me to get as far away from this man as possible. I slowly stood up to my feet, my eyes not leaving his shape.\n\nI slowly began to step towards the door. His frame just stood in the darkness like a drape, his face watching me as I walked further away.\n\nOnce I was near the door I felt my shoulder bump into something. I turned and stared at the Maid. Or rather the Maid that was not a maid.\n\nHer outfit clung to her like loose fitting rags. Her face gaunt and mouth opened exposing a pit of darkness outlined by a row of pearly white teeth. Her lower jaw jiggled with my shoulders light touch.\n\nI heard a voice in the back of my head call out to me. 'Run.' And so I did.\n\nI immediately ran down the stairs towards the front foyer. The skittering of feet following closely behind me. I reached the front door and pulled. It tugged but refused to budge. It was locked. I turned to face my pursuers but through my squinted gaze I was met with nothing more than an empty room.\n\nI started to breath heavily trying to control myself. Off down a distant hallway I heard a door open and close. It sounded like it came from Mr. Valentine's Den. I turned back to the front door and tried opening it again, looking for the latch.\n\nFootsteps began to walk down the hallway towards me.\n\nI pulled and pulled, tears welling up in my eyes again. I made a mistake. Coming to here, meeting a stranger, I was being dumb. I never should have taken the offer.\n\nEventually I screamed out at the front door and heard a soothing voice come from behind me.\n\n\"What a terrible night you seem to be having.\" It was Mr. Valentine. I turned to face him. His back was turned towards me and face obscured.\n\n\"Mr. Valentine, please, I don't want to do this anymore. Something's wrong with this place. I'm sorry, I just-\" I froze as Mr. Valentine walked closer to me. His knees protruded backwards, facing the wrong way underneath his fine silk slacks.\n\n\"My dear, you have 5 days left here.\" With that all the light faded in the Foyer. I was cast in darkness.\n\nIt wasn't until sunlight hit my face the next morning that I felt some sort of relief. I looked around me, I was in the guest bedroom. Precisely where I was the night before. I shot back up and looked around. Nothing was out of place. I heard a knocking at the door. It was the Maid.\n\n\"Madam, we've prepared breakfast for you. You wont want to miss your first lesson with Mr. Valentine. He's waiting for you.\n\nI didn't know if I could make it much longer there. Nothing made any sense.\n\nWhen I came to think of it, I couldn't even remember a single title Mr. Valentine had ever wrote.",
