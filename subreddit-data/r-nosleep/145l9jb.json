    "postText": "For the last six years, I have spent most of my spare time feeding my urge to research the paranormal. I have a normal day job of course, but the rest of my time I spend on the internet. Doppelgangers are my biggest obsession. It took hours to find the site, as well as years to find anything like it. I went through the normal websites with the crazies, claiming their neighbor was replaced by an alien coming to eat them in their sleep. So much scrolling and clicking, before I realized for about the 5th time in a month I had found myself on the dark web. The dark web is a horrifying place when you first see it, but the secrets that lie in it, in my experience have been worth the risks. \n\nEXPERIMENT 606- NO CLEARANCE BELOW LEVEL 9\n\nNow this was interesting. I have learned that by using the dark web, you can access government secrets, things organizations don't want you to know. Here's to hoping I found a goldmine. \n\nThe beginning of the page started off with several newspaper articles. \n\nMOTHER KILLS CHILD, CLAIMING HE WASN'T HIMSELF\n\n\"Oh, great. Another conspiracy blog,\" I muttered this to myself. I kept reading though. There were four more articles on this subject, all were mainly parents killing their own children, but then it became interesting. \n\n&lt;redacted&gt; REPORT JUNE 11th 2002\n\nRobin Delphy found in the residence holding a knife covered in black liquid. A being was found resembling her son, but rather than blood it oozed black liquid. Robin has been taken to psychiatric treatment, she will be led to believe she went crazy. Creature has been confiscated and brought to the lab for testing. Creature labeled experiment 707. \n\nI kept going, there were dozens of these, all with the same creature with black blood, and all \"reports\" being extremely short and vague. \n\nExperiment 606 FILE\n\nOrigin: UNKNOWN\n\nAGE: UNKNOWN\n\nABILITY: SHAPESHIFTER\n\nLOCATION: UNKNOWN\n\nWARNING: SIMPLY THINKING OF 606 WILL DRAW IT IN. ENSURE YOU ARE IN SECURE LOCATION. \n\nI laughed as I read this. Never once have I read something claiming doppelgangers could be drawn in with thoughts. I continued reading on. \n\n\\&gt;All other creatures confiscated did not have the level of intellect we have observed in 606. Most also killed their hosts before they were able to turn, but 606 only needed to see a glimpse and it could. We have already lost 6 researchers since starting with 606. The creature has escaped from our hold 10 times total. \n\nI winced at the sudden loud scraping noise hitting my window. The storm outside must have caused a branch to snap. \n\n\\&gt;Currently its status is unknown, we can only write or read about it in a secure location otherwise all researchers have been found dead. All doors and windows must be locked, 606 cannot be allowed to gain access.\n\nI laughed as I read this, clearly whoever wrote this must enjoy screwing with people. With that I clicked off of the website and decided to look elsewhere. Everything else I found was the same as it has always been. Within two hours, I was curious about the original site again but even after an hour I couldn't find it. It was as if the site never existed to begin with. I decided to just start researching random cryptids. I took out my journal, jotting down little things I found. Once again a loud abrupt noise came from outside the window. This time I sighed and went back to my writing. I eventually got to my page on doppelgangers, I wrote small bits and pieces I found from the site, specifically about 606 and its abilities. I heard a loud bang from inside my kitchen as I did. \n\nGetting up and walking to the kitchen, the only off thing was a porcelain cup that had been knocked onto the ground, and my cat Bert staring at it. I sighed, \"Bert, seriously? That was an expensive cup.\" Bert's emerald eyes met mine, and he seemed to let out a huff before slinking away. I just shook my head as I cleaned up the mess, but the entire time I felt as if I wasn't alone in that room. My research could sometimes lead to a bit of paranoia, so it wasn't much of a shock to me that I was having these feelings. \n\nI came back in the room to see the page back up, but this time it looked different. It had somehow not only brought back the page, but it appeared to have pulled up new files from the researcher. \n\n\\&gt;My door is locked. My windows are locked. I swear, I swear, I swear. I hear it, I can never stop thinking about the creature. I cannot leave my house. I cannot take the risk I will forget to lock the door. I cannot end up like the other researchers, I CANT CANT CANT. My family? Why did I take this job when I have a family. NONONONO.\n\nThere was an entire page of this nonsense, and it slowly trailed off into psychotic rambling. I was starting to feel my stomach drop as I read this. I exited the tab, but as soon as I did small pop ups filled my screen. The words were all the same. \n\n\"DID YOU LOCK YOUR DOOR?\" \n\nThe joke was no longer funny, and I became annoyed realizing this stupid website must have sent a virus to my computer. \n\n\"DID YOU LOCK YOUR DOOR, JANE?\"\n\nMy eyes grew wide at the use of my name, and I unplugged my computer within seconds. As I did, I could have sworn I heard the tiniest giggle coming from somewhere in the house. I decided quickly it was time to call it quits for the night. \n\nEven after all of this, I cannot shake off the unpleasant feeling in my gut. Currently as I finish this, my only thought in my mind is I don't remember if I locked my back door. I'm in my bathroom finishing up my night time routine while writing this on my phone, and I know my mirror should only have one of me in it. Instead, I can see two of my faces staring back at me, and the one behind me has a smile so wide it seems inhuman. Last time I checked, I also don't think I'm giggling. ",
