    "postText": "We decided to go for a drive in the countryside one Saturday morning. I\u2019m the type of person who usually plans everything, leaving nothing to chance. I\u2019m not spontaneous at all and it gets on my wife\u2019s nerves. This was going to be different. It was all my idea and I assured Tammy we were just going to \u2018wing it\u2019. She rolled her eyes. She knows me. She realizes even my \u2018spontaneous\u2019 excursions are planned, somehow. \n\nThe truth is, it bothers me to not have a game plan. I\u2019m usually the one driving on these rogue adventures and I have to decide to turn left or right if there\u2019s no predetermined path or destination. I hate doing that with a passion but I wanted to prove to her I could drive without advance research or scouting. Inside it was going to kill me, but I had to pretend to be ok with it. You know how couples can get. I had to prove her \u2018wrong\u2019. \n\nWe loaded up the car with a couple of bottles of water and snacks before steering toward the rural part of the state. In the beginning, I\u2019d been to parts of the area, but the longer we drove, the further I left behind my comfort zone. Tammy was loving it. I\u2019d glance over at her occasionally and she\u2019d have this genuine glow of contentment from the random drive. I sincerely think part of the enjoyment was relishing in my discomfort, but I wasn\u2019t about to let on. Regardless, I wasn\u2019t much of an actor and we both knew I was a bundle of knots inside. \n\nEvery few miles we\u2019d see an old farmhouse or weathered barn with cows in the pasture. The scenery was lush and picturesque. The weather itself was beautiful too. All in all, for a random drive in the country being officiated by an obsessive planner, it was pretty darn enjoyable. I didn\u2019t feel the crippling apprehension which usually came over me when I was trying to find a specific location in the dark. It was easier to be \u2018lost\u2019 in the daylight, with no set agenda. You might even say I was adjacent to enjoying myself. \n\nThe deeper Tammy and I drove into \u2018Nowheresville\u2019, the more we started noticing some odd little things. There were weird symbols painted on the side of the houses and barns visible from the old county road. They weren\u2019t anything either of us was familiar with, but clearly they meant something to the locals. The first few didn\u2019t register as anything to take note of, but eventually it became an obvious thing which stood out, in an otherwise idyllic country drive. I found myself anticipating them with each new home we approached. All of the symbols were somewhat different in \u2018character\u2019 formation, but they were similar enough to be related. \n\nNeither of us spoke about them at the time but those strange markings troubled us, deeply. It was definitely on our minds when we stopped at a small country store for supplies, and to use the bathroom. As is usually the case with folks in the countryside, the store owners were very friendly. We must\u2019ve stood out like sore thumbs, because they asked where we were from. We bought food and drinks for the road, and yukked it up with them for a couple minutes.\n\nThat is, until I summoned the courage to ask what the symbols on the buildings meant. Immediately their whole demeanor changed. It was night and day. Tammy noticed it too. She looked at me with a side-eyed glance as their mood darkened. To their credit, they didn\u2019t try to change the subject. That would\u2019ve been too obvious; but they did look down the aisles first to make sure there were no other customers within earshot, before answering. That definitely raised our hackles. It was creepy as hell. The truth was apparently something \u2018outsiders\u2019 like us weren\u2019t supposed to know. \n\nSuddenly it felt like we were about to be sucked into the middle of a rural conspiracy. They leaned over and whispered: \u201cYou folks seem real nice. Please don\u2019t ask anyone else about them. It\u2019s for \u2018protection\u2019, and for heaven\u2019s sake, don\u2019t be around here once the sun goes down. There\u2019s a full moon tonight and they prefer the dark.\u201d\n\nI looked at Tammy\u2019s mortified face. Her reaction was probably the same as my own. The suspense widened. We kept waiting for them to burst out laughing about winding up the big city folks, but the grins never came. They just handed us our receipt and told us to have a safe trip back home. There was a strong emphasis on us leaving soon. Like a couple of traumatized school kids, we thanked them for their prior hospitality and walked out. It was already dusk, and we were halfway across the state. We\u2019d been seeing those bizarre markers for fifty miles or more. \n\nWas it some secret sect? Tammy dared to take a photo of one of the \u2018protection markers\u2019 with her phone as we drove back toward home but the internet service in the boonies was spotty, at best. Since it was some deeply held rural secret, she hoped an image search would tell us what they meant. The country store proprietors acted like it was blood painted on the door of their homes to signal for the Biblical Angel of Death to pass them by. \n\nNight fell quickly, with us still being in the middle of \u2018Nowheresville\u2019. We were definitely spooked and needed fuel for the car. Predictably, there were no stations around and the needle was below \u2018E\u2019. My OCD nerves were kicking way in. I was tempted to lash-out about why THIS is the reason I didn\u2019t like to be spontaneous, but I held my tongue. It wouldn\u2019t have helped. The image lookup netted very little helpful information. The only thing she could find was that it was somehow tied to \u2018a secretive society of occult Freemasons\u2019. \n\nWhat? There were too many of them for it to be an \u2018inside joke on city folks exploring the backroads\u2019. We wouldn\u2019t have thought there would be anything other that devout religious people living in that isolated section of the county. Not only that, but what did the shop owner\u2019s vague statement mean? \u2018They prefer the dark\u2019? They made it sound like there were bloodthirsty werewolves roaming the woods. As laughable as it sounded, they weren\u2019t laughing when they said it, and they didn\u2019t appear to be kidding either. \n\nThey warned us to be completely out of the area before nightfall, and yet here we were, running on fumes and hoping to find a gas station before we were stranded like sitting ducks. The wind picked up until it blew our little car around like a sailboat in a churning sea. If there was any good from our unplanned misadventure, it was that all the dust we\u2019d picked up from the long drive would hopefully be blown off the car. \n\nIt was barely 9pm on a Saturday night but every house we passed was as dark as could be. Not a single light shone in any of their windows. Either they went to bed early in the country, or they didn\u2019t want to invite strangers to their doors after dark. Intellectually I knew rural folk were known to sleep early, but I couldn\u2019t help but hear the shopkeepers conspiratorial words echo again in my ears. I couldn\u2019t see Tammy\u2019s face well but I know her. She was dwelling on it too. Under the circumstances it would\u2019ve been impossible to ignore. \n\nAs growing nightmares tend to do, the car began to shudder. It was choking on its last few ounces of fuel left in the line. I wanted to shake the steering wheel in terrified frustration but it\u2019s an inanimate object. I\u2019m the damn fool goaded into \u2018proving how unprepared I could be\u2019. This was my \u2018reward\u2019. I was going to have to walk in the dark with a gas can until I found the next house. Then I was going to have to beat on their front door and hope they would take mercy on us. It was the perfect checkbox list of \u2018NO!\u2019 for me. \n\nWalk alone in the dark. The FULL MOON dark. \n\nTraverse a rural two lane blacktop where I didn\u2019t know a single soul. \n\nAsk for help from total strangers that could have been avoided if I\u2019d just used my damn head in the first place. \n\nAnd the \u2018piece de resistance\u2019:\n\nBe on the lookout for \u2018werewolves\u2019 or Moses\u2019 Angel of Death sent to kill the firstborn sons. \n\nMy own anger generated a certain level of false bravado which I needed to \u2018get it done\u2019. I cursed myself for not having gas already in the fuel can in the trunk but the truth is, I would\u2019ve been afraid it was an explosion risk. It\u2019s hell being an over-thinker. Tammy had the audacity to ask where I was going. I just turned toward her with a disgruntled scowl. She didn\u2019t mean it the way it came out. It was obvious I had to go for help. She just didn\u2019t want to be alone in the car. I think she felt bad for all of her past attempts to \u2018loosen me up\u2019 about over-planning things. Perhaps on the eve of our mutual doom, I might\u2019ve won one. Ah, the bittersweet irony. \n\nThe two of us held hands. We\u2019d started the journey together and we\u2019d finish it together. Whatever that meant. Like a gentleman, I placed her away from the roadway but it was mostly a symbolic gesture. There were no other cars driving by. She was the first to notice how quiet it was as we walked. There was only the sound of our shoes clacking the pavement. In a place with all manner of wild animals living in nature, it was deathly silent. She gripped my hand tightly. It seemed like we\u2019d walked a long way but the truth is, we were relatively lucky. The nearest farmhouse was less than a mile from our stranded vehicle.\n\nLike the rest, it had one of those arcane symbols painted right on the front door. Also like the others, there wasn\u2019t a single light shining in their windows but the driveway had three cars. They were definitely home but I had my doubts they would answer us. We didn\u2019t want to be shot for startling them so we tried to make some unsubtle noises on the doorstep to announce our benevolent presence. Country folks like their twelve gauge shotguns. I hoped they would realize we were harmless and in need of help. \n\nWe both heard sounds of lamentation coming from inside. If anything, they were more frightened than we were. I\u2019d characterize it as terrified. I spoke up in my friendliest voice to reassure them. \n\n\u201cHello there. We\u2019re terribly sorry to bother you folks so late at night. We\u2019re just passing through from out of town and our car ran out of gas.  Do you happen to have some? We\u2019d be happy to reimburse you. I\u2019ve got a hundred dollar bill. I can slide it under your door as compensation.\u201d\n\nA man on the other side spoke up. There was a noticeable tremor in his voice. He appeared to be trying very hard to balance his innate sense of politeness and hospitality, with a crumbling wall of courage. It didn\u2019t bode well to reassure either of us.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m terribly sorry for your trouble mister, but there\u2019s something very evil lurking in these parts you don\u2019t want to encounter. They come out at night time and for that precise reason, we don\u2019t dare open the front door, for anyone. I\u2019d be happy to siphon some of my own gas for you; but I won\u2019t set foot out there until daylight. I have to protect myself and my family. I hope you understand. Now, run back to your car and lock the doors. Quickly! Cover up the windows and take this and put it on the hood of your vehicle in a conspicuous place. It\u2019ll save your lives.\u201d\n\nIn the unnatural quietness of the night air, I heard the electronic whirl of an inkjet printer running inside their home. A piece of letter-sized paper slid under the door jamb. It contained one of those strange symbols. \n\n\u201cLeave your fuel can on the porch. I\u2019ll bring some gas, first light. I promise. If they come for you, do not look them in the eye. Go!\u201d\n\nWe did exactly as instructed. To the letter. I gotta tell ya, the missus and I would\u2019ve been \u2018husband and wife, three-legged race\u2019 winners if we\u2019d entered such a competition. Both of us sprinted at a pace I hardly thought possible. I could barely keep up with her. Then I scrambled to get the keys to open the door. It might\u2019ve been comical if we weren\u2019t racing for our lives. Inside, we located a sun-visor and blankets to block off the windows as best we could. An old paper road map and catalogs from the glove compartment served to complete the job, in record time. \n\nWe were almost in the clear when I realized the most important part of the plan wasn\u2019t in place. The protection sign was still in the car with us! I didn\u2019t have any masking tape so there was no way to secure it to the window or hood. Using a rock as a paperweight would\u2019ve blocked it from being visible. In a flash of invention I had an idea. The SUV was so dusty from the county roads that I scrawled the symbol as large as I could into the dirt of the windshield, hood and trunk with my fingers. I hoped that would suffice to spare us from the fury of whatever frightening creatures roamed the hillsides during the full moon. \n\nI jumped back inside just in time. First the smell hit us. It was positively rank and the source of the stench was very, very large. We could feel \u2018them\u2019 walking around the car inspecting it. There were tiny voids in our hasty wallpapering of the windows but I didn\u2019t dare look through the cracks. I was too scared I\u2019d make eye contact. We heard them pulling on the door handles to see if they were unlocked. I have absolutely no doubt anything that huge could\u2019ve simply ripped them open but that apparently wasn\u2019t the point. They were checking to see if we\u2019d taken the precaution of locking them. \n\nTammy had to stifle a scream as the whole vehicle shook back and forth violently. I thought the intent was to flip it upside down. She looked at me in wide-eyed terror. I\u2019d love to suggest she drew strength from my calm masculinity but that would be a bold-faced lie. It was all I could do to keep from squealing like a toddler myself. The things on the other side of the car were definitely not natural. That much was clear to us. Then one of them spoke with a \u2018voice\u2019, not of this earth.\n\n\u201cYou drew our sacred sigil of mercy on your vehicle, incorrectly. You have parts of the character backwards but we have decided to forgive your ignorance, this time. Leave our home and never return again. Our patience is limited.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you!\u201d; We both cried out in unison. Without response, they finally left us, but we dared not leave the impotent \u2018safety\u2019 of the car to confirm their departure; even to use the bathroom. Leftover drink cups temporarily served that purpose.\n\nIn the morning, the farmer came just as he\u2019d promised. He brought us fuel and something to eat. Not that either of us had an appetite. He saw the evidence of our nocturnal visitors and remarked how fortunate we were, especially with my botched depiction of the \u2018sigil\u2019, as they had referred to them. We thanked the man again and we\u2019re on our way. Neither of us breathed a sign of relief until we reached the suburbs. \n\nI drove through an automated car wash to blast off the layers of dirt from our terrifying ordeal, but it didn\u2019t do anything about the savage claw marks and unnatural dents to the sheet metal. I told my coworkers it was from a grizzly bear attack. That would\u2019ve been horrific enough story, but the truth was infinitely worse. These so-called \u2018grizzly bears\u2019 could speak, read, and took considerable umbrage to my poorly drawn protection sigils. \n\nMy insurance agent demanded to inspect the damage first. He asked me where it occurred. I told him and he adopted the same pale demeanor change as the country store owners. He knew what we faced that night. Obviously there had been other claims like ours over the years. Without acknowledging what we both knew, he said: \u201cYou two are lucky to be alive. Don\u2019t go back there again. Your claim will be covered in full. And one more thing, that sigil should look like this.\u201d\n\nHe pointed to the clean area of the windshield where I had drawn it. Despite it being washed, you could still see the remnants of my \u2018artwork\u2019 on the glass. He took his finger and reversed one of the vertical marks in the middle. Now I know the correct way to draw it. More importantly, Tammy doesn\u2019t try to stop me from planning out all the details of our trips anymore. She finally sees the benefit of NOT being spontaneous. Win-win.",
