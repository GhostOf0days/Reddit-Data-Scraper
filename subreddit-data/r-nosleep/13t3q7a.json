    "postText": "Despite my skepticism, I've always been a fan of a good horror story. A few weeks ago, I stumbled across some reviews online about a supposedly amazing new horror novel. I'll copy two of the reviews that stood out the most to me. Do note, I edited the reviews slightly to fix spelling and grammatical errors.\n\n\"Creepy and disturbing, [Redacted] is a fantastic novel worthy of at least one read. It explores the psyche of the human mind, and our approach to things we find creepy and supernatural. The author did a fantastic job setting up a story, and tearing apart the mind to explore our deepest, darkest fears. I won't spoil too much, but I highly reccomend purchasing this book before it's too late.\"\n\nToo late? Why would it be too late? Even if it sells out, in a few months, second-hand copies will show up all over the place. There's never a 'perfect' time to read a book. As for the second review.\n\n\"Do not touch this book. Stay as far away from it as possible. If it's in a library or store near you, my best advice is to move. Find a new place to stay, or better yet, burn down the location. Either get as far away from it as possible, or destroy it as soon as possible. This book is demonic! It is pure evil and should not even be acknowledged! May Our Father forgive us.\"\n\nNow, I didn't know exactly why this review stood out so much to me at the time, after all, it's probably just the ravings of another religious fanatic, right? Well, hindsight's a bitch. Perhaps if I was that bit smarter, perhaps if I was slightly less skeptical, I wouldn't have brushed it off like that, but that's what I did.\n\nSo, being a fan of good horror, I decided to purchase the book. It took rather a while to get delivered, to the point I had almost forgotten about it. The day it did arrive was a strange one. An unmarked black van pulled into my driveway. Now, while I'm skeptic of supernatural dangers, I'm all too aware about the ones that the real world presents. A man in a black suit and hat stepped out of the van and approached my gate. \n\nI quickly grabbed my phone and went to dial 911. Something stopped me in my tracks though. He called out my full name. How would he know that? His next comment quickly answered that. He had a delivery for me. He held up a black book with white words engraved near the top. I squinted and could make out the title of the book I ordered. Okay, weird. I went outside and accepted the delivery.\n\n\"Where do I sign?\" I asked, slightly taken aback by the strangeness of this whole affair. What kind of delivery company doesn't have a logo?\n\n\"Not necessary.\" He responded with a gravelly voice and a tip of his hat. \"Enjoy.\" He turned and walked back to his van.\n\n\"Wait!\" I called out. I had so many questions, but he just seemed to ignore me as he entered the van and slowly backed out of the driveway.\n\nI stood there, at the gate, reading the title. It certainly was the book I ordered, with a small white price tag at the bottom, the exact price I had paid online. I flipped open the book and the very first page was completely blank, except for black text in the center.\n\n\"In memory of the damned. As you read their stories, remember always one simple rule. Never say their names out loud.\"\n\nI shook my head, that was likely just some comment for immersion's sake. I snapped the book closed and headed inside. I made myself a cup of tea and got comfortable. It was getting late, and a creepy story and a warm drink was the perfect way to end the day.\n\nThe first few pages were your run of the mill horror. Small children screaming for their parents about monsters they saw under the bed, strange sightings when the power goes out and so on. The more I read though, the progressively stranger, and more personal it got. There was a story that started on Page 39 about a child who nearly drowned in a pool, it described the environment in such poetic detail. \n\nAround the pool was a brick path, beside it were multiple fruit trees, under which sat a white, stone bench. The environment sounded so similar to the pool in my parents' old place. I chalked it up to coincidence, until the child was named. My name.\n\nIn a moment of shock and awe, I read the name again, out loud. Was this story about me? I continued reading, and it described a banshee-like creature with long, black claws dragging the child into the water by their ankles. I remember that, no one believed me. I just went in too deep, wasn't ready. Just an accidental near-drowning. Monsters aren't real. And so the story went in the book as well. No one believed the child about this banshee they clearly saw. \n\nThis story was about me. How? I didn't recognize the author's name, or anything about this book. I only told that story to a few people. Did they tell it to other people and it spread? That must be it. This book is a collection of short stories from all over the globe. This was likely just a case of someone in my family knowing someone who knew the author, and he just never came up.\n\nStill, I found it very annoying that he didn't bother changing my name. That's how these books usually go. All names have been changed for the safety of the victims. Nothing like that on the front page though. My emotions quickly went from concern to mild irratation at the amateur nature of this author.\n\nI finished reading the story about the child that nearly drowned, despite knowing exactly how it would end. But something caught my eye. The ending was different.\n\n\"And there, as the child lay asleep, outside the bedroom window stood the banshee, waiting to strike again.\"\n\nWas this added fiction just for the sake of a little scare? Did he know something more than I thought? These thoughts raced across my mind, but ultimately I thought it was pointless to go on a mental journey about some dumb book. I closed the book and set it on my desk, then went to sleep.\n\nThe next morning when I woke up, the first thing I noticed scared me to the core. There, against my bedroom window were several long scratches downward, scratches that slightly cracked the window. It's important that you understand, my bedroom window is situated in a pathway with very tall, locked gates on either side, and across from the window is a very tall wall, with electric wire. The likelihood that someone could just get there during the night and scratch the window without my noticing is very slim. There aren't trees or animals that could've done that either. And none of these would crack the window just scratching it.\n\nI tried to explain the scratches as best I could, but I could find no logical explanation. Was the book right? Was the banshee back because I read my own name aloud? It felt so dumb to even consider that as an option. Ghosts and monsters aren't real. Books don't hold any supernatural power. In that swimming pool, I was drowning. I was delusional, but what else could have caused this?\n\nThere was one course of action I could think of. In the case that this was some supernatural force at work. I grabbed the book and went to the grill outside. I dropped it inside and set it alight, watching as the fire slowly consumed it, the paper coiling in on itself and turning to ash with each passing second. I stared at the fire as it burned for nealy half an hour and slowly burned out.\n\nWhen that was all done, I went on a walk to clear my mind. I tried to answer any questions I had about this whole ordeal on the walk, I couldn't. Some of it just didn't make any sense. When I finally returned home, I went to my study, with the intent to get back to work. I was halted in my tracks by a most disturbing sight, however. There, sitting on my desk just as I had left it the night before, was the damn book. The same one I burned.\n\nDid someone see me burning it, then sneak in and replace it while I was out? Once again, that would be very difficult considering the secure nature of my home, with all the locked gates and electric wire. Perhaps this was just a very determined prankster. When I was younger, I did have a friend who would do these sort of things all the time. Though he passed a few years ago. Perhaps he had like-minded friends and they thought this was a fun way to pass the time. I flipped open the book to read that rule again. \n\n\"In memory of the damned. As you read their stories, remember always one simple rule. Never say their names out loud.\"\n\nWas that first line supposed to mean something? Were they referring to this old friend? If this was a prank, I had to hand it to them, they certainly put in a lot of effort. Slightly disturbing, using a person's dead friend to play a joke on them, but that's the way of some people.\n\nOnce again, a small spell of paranoia poked at the back of my mind. If at all this was supernatural, I had to get rid of this damn book. I grabbed it and decided to go on a drive. My town is surrouned by very large mountains, and somewhere on those mountains are deep rivers. I drove up to the mountain gates. Locked. No matter, I got of the car and climbed over the gate, then made my way up the path. \n\nI didn't notice it at first, but the sun was setting, which meant the night animals would be coming out soon. At least I knew to expect strange noises. As I hiked towards the river, I felt a very chilling sensation across my body, as if it the winter had come early. That was very strange, given it was the middle of summer.\n\nI chalked it up to the nightly air, and continued on my way. After about an hour of hiking, I finally made it to the river and dropped the book in the water. My eye caught something that made my heart sink. As the book touched the water, something swam underneath it. Something that looked human. At this time of day there's almost no one around, and less so anyone swimming.\n\nI tried to make my way back to the car as quickly as possible, trying to ignore what I saw. There was no logical explanation outside of the supernatural. None that I could come up with anyway, and I did not want to accept the latter. The drive home was unnerving, to say the least. My mind stuck on that one moment. What was under that book? Was it just some random person swimming? Was it something else?\n\nI couldn't sleep that night. I tried and failed. The tapping on my window kept me awake, but I dared not look to confirm my suspicions. I kept my back to the window all night. Once the sun started rising and casting light into my room, the tapping stopped. I got up and immediately went to my study. I didn't look inside. I just closed and locked the door. I didn't have to look. I know that book is on my desk.\n\nEach night it's the same thing. The tapping on my window is steady, I've gotten used to it. Ironically, it helps me fall asleep now. I'm not going to look. I know what's outside.",
