    "postText": "///11th of June, 2006\n\n\u201cDad, the moon!\u201d I shouted as I entered the garage. My father was on the floor, under his Bugatti 57SC Atlantic, obsessively removing and re-installing pieces of the car like he always did. He quickly got up, a smile on his grease-stained face. \n\n\u201cFinally!\u201d He said with his beer-breath, grabbing a towel and cleaning most of his face, before running outside as fast as he could. I followed him. I don\u2019t know why I always liked these moments. Any child would find them terribly boring. But I always reveled on them. Maybe it\u2019s because they were the only moments he smiled. He positioned his telescope on our front yard, adjusted the lens, drank a beer can and started looking at the full moon above us. \n\n\u201cDo you see it?\u201d I asked, sitting on the grass next to him. \n\n\u201cShut up.\u201d He said, still looking. After half an hour of waiting, he started laughing. I opened my mouth to ask if he was seeing it, but I held my voice. Didn\u2019t want to anger him. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s blinking! It\u2019s blinking Johnathan!\u201d He laughed. I smiled. That wasn\u2019t my name, though he called me that. Only several years later I would learn that was the name of his deceased younger brother. Every full moon, we would come look at it with the telescope. And he\u2019d always call me Johnathan. Probably because he was always so drunk. But from always avoiding me or calling me \u201cBrat\u201d, Johnathan was a nice shift. \n\n\u201cCan I see?\u201d I asked, and he lowered the tripod so I could see the moon. There was a small light blinking on it\u2019s surface. It was truly beautiful. \n\n\u201cFine, my turn again.\u201d My father shoved me back, adjusted the tripod back, and started looking at it again. \u201cIt\u2019s blinking so much tonight\u2026 Maybe\u2026 Brat, get my camera!\u201d He shouted at me. I quickly went inside the house, and looked around for the camera in the living room. There it was, on a little pile of beer cans and empty rythmol boxes in the corner of the room. I hurried back outside, as fast as I could, as I did not want to anger my father.\n\nI stopped on my tracks as soon as I was out of the house. There was a strange being involving my father. It looked like a snake, but I knew it was anything but a snake. There were not snakes that big where I lived. And certainly not with human faces. My father seemed oblivious to it, looking through his telescope, but the thing was all around him, from the bottom of his legs all the way to the top of his head. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s blinking so much\u2026\u201d He said, in awe. The creature looked at me, locking eyes with me, and smiled, revealing several sets of sharp fangs. And then, it disappeared. My father looked at me, he was sweating. \u201cI think\u2026 I need to lay down for a bit\u2026\u201d He muttered, before falling on the grass. I spent the entire night trying to wake him up, before my mother found me there crying the following day.\n\n///09th of November 2021\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s why you decided to study astronomy? Really?\u201d Melissa laughed. \n\n\u201cOh, come on, babe\u2026 Don\u2019t make fun of my tragic past.\u201d I said, finishing my waffles. She went to the fridges, grabbed the orange juice, and poured some in our cups. \n\n\u201cShall we toast?\u201d She asked. \n\n\u201cWith orange juice? And what for?\u201d\n\n\u201cYour impending graduation. What else?\u201d \n\n\u201cImpending? Ha! I didn\u2019t even start my capstone thesis.\u201d \n\n\u201cSo, what will it be about? Venus, right? Or was it Mars?\u201d \n\n\u201cNope. Too many people I know will already be working on planets like Venus and Mars. I thought about Neptune, but it\u2019s too far away. So I figured, why not the Moon?\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease, don\u2019t tell me this is about your father.\u201d\n\n\u201cMel, he wasn\u2019t the best dad in the world. But he did left me his collection of vintage cars. This is what paid for my education.\u201d \n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t left it to you, it was divided between you and your mother.\u201d\n\n\u201cRegardless, I feel like I owe him this. Apart from the cars, the moon was the only thing he loved.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou owe him nothing, Ezra.\u201d \n\n\u201cI need to know what the blinking lights are! Lunar transient phenomena, it\u2019s how they call them. There\u2019s no scientific explanation to what they are.\u201d \n\n\u201cJust because there\u2019s no known scientific explanation, it doesn\u2019t mean one does not exist. And if there\u2019s one, it\u2019s certainly not creepy snake-man\u201d She laughed. \n\n///04th of September, 2022\n\nThe first thing you feel when you start seriously investigating the moon is how mysterious it is. We only went there a handful of times, and then never again. All reasons are given for this, but it never really felt right to me. Maybe what happened to my father always made me feel paranoid about the subject, but I somehow felt there were things about the moon that were hiding on plain sight. \n\nThe focus of my research, the lunar transient phenomena, is incredibly unknown. Few studies were done about it, and most of them were never published or were abandoned. The few that were made available were either from little-known universities in third-world countries, in languages that I couldn\u2019t understand and without English translation, or mere compilations of recorded occurrences. I found some theories. The lights were caused by magnetism, or by gasses, or by asteroids, perspective\u2026\n\nBut mere hypothesis were not enough for me. I needed to know. I needed to understand. I needed\u2026 I needed to confirm it weren\u2019t those lights who killed my father that day. \n\nSo, I delved deep into the research. I spent weeks in my bedroom, reading books and more books, entering all sorts of websites, sending emails to experts, looking for anything that could give me more information. But through all my effort, the only thing I could find were theories or hypothesis, all of them with little to no evidence. In my search for answers, I started straying further away from modern science, entering strange websites and reading books that talked about blatant pseudoscience, like astrology or the paranormal.\n\n///17th of February, 2022\n\n\u201cSo, what books will you be basing your capstone on?\u201d My orienting professor asked. I could not see his face properly, we were talking through a videocall and he was not very tech savvy, so his eyes and nose were out of the frame.\n\n\u201cChris, I can only see your mouth!\u201d I laughed. \n\n\u201cSorry\u2026\u201d He said, adjusting his camera. The framing was not perfect yet, but it was better. \"Have you read the books I sent you?\"\n\n\"They... They were not what I was looking for.\"\n\n\"What were you looking for, Ezra?\"\n\n\"I told you. Answers. I have been looking for answers, yet I only find questions.\"\n\n\"We will only be able to find real answers when we actually set a lab on the moon.  Until then, we will have to live with merely hypothesizing.\"\n\n\"I know, but...\"\n\n\"Have you tried reading Kulikovsky?Or Hakan Kayal? Non-american studies in general.\"\n\n\"Yes, professor Chris. But... All studies seem to contradict themselves. Some point to studies that I can\u2019t find anywhere, like they don\u2019t exist anymore. Like they were erased by someone\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cSome texts were never made digital or registered. It\u2019s very unfortunate.\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone tries to find a logical explanation... What if there isn't one?\"\n\n\"What is this truly about?\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"It's just... You do know you can change your capstone thesis theme, right? Maybe an analysis of something more well-known could work better with your methodology.\"\n\n\"Chris, I will not change my mind. We have discussed this before.\"\n\n\"Well, well... I talked to one of my former colleagues, he is retired now, who also studied the moon, but his research was more focused on gravity. He told me there's a book called \"A Study of the Moon with a New Lens\" or something like that. Written by one Dr. Karl Hollfern in 1935.\"\n\n\"That is way before LTP was even catalogued.\"\n\n\"Catalogued, yes. Recorded? No. Hollfern studied extensevely the lunar mysteries. Unfortunately, he was executed by the Nazis because he opposed them. But his research lived on. My friend told me they have one of his books in the library. But it's in German.\"\n\n///18th of February, 2022\n\nI entered the library carrying a bag full of German grammar books and a dictionary. I would not let a little language barrier stop me from getting to the truth. \n\n\u201cHello, how can I help you?\u201d The librarian asked, barely averting her eyes from her cellphone.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m actually looking for a book that could either be in the astronomy section or in the foreign titles section\u2026 Can you help me?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich book?\u201d She was still looking at her phone, seemingly playing one of those generic casual mobile games.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s in German. Old, from the 1930s. Talks about studies of the moon made at the time.\u201d \n\n\u201cUnusual request, but ok\u2026\u201d She put her phone on the counter, and started typing on the computer. \u201cCan\u2019t find it. Do you have the author\u2019s name?\u201d\n\n\u201cKarl Hollfern.\u201d \n\n\u201cUncanny. It\u2019s unlisted.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have it in the library, but it\u2019s not available. We usually do this when books are being cleaned. Usually takes a couple of days\u2026 It says it won\u2019t be listed until\u2026 Until 2100? \n\n\u201cWhat? How does this makes sense?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve been working here for sixteen years, and have never seen something like this. Regardless, I can\u2019t lend you the book. I can\u2019t even let you access it in library grounds.\u201d \n\n///23rd of February, 2022\n\nI was drinking my Starbucks cappuccino while trying to make myself comfortable on the shopping mall bench, to no avail. I was tense. I had never involved myself with something like this. If my mother or girlfriend knew, they would kill me. An older man made his way out of the crowd and patiently sat down next to me. \n\n\u201cYou were supposed to be sitting on the bench next to Nike. But no problem.\u201d He laughed.\n\n\u201cSorry. I got confused\u2026\u201d I facepalmed.\n\n\u201cI got the book you asked me too. But the price is going to be different in your case.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs in more expensive?\u201d \n\n\u201cNo. Normally, I charge twenty five grand, or double If the job is hard. In your case, the job was ridiculously easy. I will be charging five grand only.\u201d \n\n\u201cThanks! I\u2019m transferring to your account right now\u2026\u201d I said as I typed on my phone.  \n\n\u201cThe book is in your car.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow did you\u2026 Oh, of course.\u201d\n\n\u201cPleasure doing business with you.\u201d He got up and left. I immediately went to my car. There it was, Eine Untersuchung des Mondes mit einer neuen Linse. \n\n///28th of February, 2022\n\n\u201cHoney, are you still awake?\u201d Melissa asked me. I was sitting on a pillow in the corner of the room, aggressively doing more and more Duolingo lessons. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m busy, Mel.\u201d I said, without averting my eyes from the green owl.\n\n\u201cIs this about that German book you have been taking everywhere?\u201d \n\n\u201cNo\u2026\u201d I blatantly lied. \n\n\u201cHoney, you\u2019ve been up all night. It\u2019s ten to six.\u201d \n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d \n\n\u201cYou are obsessed with this shit, Ezra! Look at you! This is the third time I find you here studying German instead of sleeping!\u201d \n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but you do know I have a capstone thesis to finish, don\u2019t you?!\u201d I screamed back at her.\n\n\u201cOh. So this is what\u2019s all about, right?\u201d \n\n\u201cBabe, it\u2019s not like that\u2026\u201d Before I could say anything, she stormed out of the apartment. I stood there, frozen, for a minute or two, before I went back to my Duolingo. \n\n///3rd of March, 2022\n\n\u201cHello Ezra\u201d Chris said, as I adjusted my camera. As usual, I couldn\u2019t see his face properly. \n\n\u201cGood evening, professor Chris.\u201d \n\n\u201cEzra, are you okay? You look tired.\u201d \n\n\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d I said vehemently.\n\n\u201cEzra\u2026 I\u2026 I have bad news for you.\u201d When he said that, I felt like a hand was smashing my heart. \u201cThe university has rejected your intended theme.\u201d \n\n\u201cW-what?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have to pick something else. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat? Why?!\u201d\n\n\u201cApparently there\u2019s information about Lunar Transient Phenomena that is undisclosed to the general public. The feds were here yesterday, talked with the dean about it. Said that researching the LTP was considered meddling in national security affairs, and that all projects focusing on it were to be halted.\u201d\n\n\u201cBullshit!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I know how much time you have already invested in this. But we\u2019ll find something else, Ezra. There are more lunar mys\u2026\u201d I interrupted him.\n\n\u201cWhy is it so hard to research a simple lunar phenomena?! Every time I advance, everyone tries to block me! They will not stop me from uncovering what happened to my father!\u201d I slammed the table. \n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cThis will not stop me.\u201d I muttered, while ending the videocall. \n\n///8th of March, 2022\n\nAfter some turbulent days, I was finally making progress again. My knowledge of German wasn\u2019t great, but knowing basic grammar, using online dictionaries, and with a little help from online German studying communities, I was making my way through the book. \n\nThe book was almost a century old, yet I felt like I was finally making progress. The research by Hollfern was fascinating, but disturbing. He described how the \u201cblinking moonlights\u201d if watched carefully, could be interpreted as having meaning. My German was advancing but far from perfect, so I didn\u2019t have the exact translation, but it said something about the moon speaking in some sort of secret code using the lights. \n\nIt also referenced some books, most of which seemed to not exist anymore, but some of them not only existed, I also managed to download their scanned PDFs. It was pretty unorthodox for a scientific study. There was a book on symbols and sigils of different religions, a compilation of theological texts about Gnosticism, a book compiling works by Schopenhauer, and a Hindi scroll explaining Chakras.\n\nI didn\u2019t understood yet how everything connected. Seemed like a strange collection of unrelated weirdness. \n\n///10th of March, 2022\n\nI stumbled upon something I had previously overlooked. There\u2019s an work by Schopenhauer where he discuss reading the Upanishads, which are old Hindi texts. The Hindi text I had downloaded was translated to English, but what if I looked for the original? Maybe there was something I wasn\u2019t shown. \n\nThe original had a section that was censored in the English version that talked about a Devas that was corrupted by an evil unknown entity called that attached on it\u2019s solar plexus and made it miserable with overwhelming sadness and pain. A thing described as a floating jester.\n\n///13th of March, 2022\n\nThe phone in the living room started ringing. I left it there, unwilling to stop reading the book and trying to translate the contents. The call went to voicemail, and then I heard the caller recording it:\n\n\u201cHey Ezra, I know you\u2019re going through a bad time, but as your orienting professor, I care for you. You didn't show up for any of your tests. I know you seem to be focused on your research, but this isn't the-\" I unplugged the damn thing.\n\n///16th of March, 2022\n\nI got evicted after not paying my rent. Or I was supposed to be at least. I picked up my research stuff and rented a cheap motel room on the outskirts of my town. I could not pay for the rent, and least not for now, I spent most of my money buying books and old magazines during the last weeks. I don\u2019t need a place to call mine for now. I just need to find the truth. \n\nI know the government will come after me. I\u2019m coming too close. But if they want me to stop, they will have to kill me. I\u2019ve already lost everything. This investigation is all I have left. \n\n///18th of March, 2022\n\nThere's an old website that I found while researching. A true relic, seems to be from the early 90s. It contains old conspiracies theories, like stuff about the Illuminati and New Age, Satanic Panic, how Ronald Reagan was actually replaced, among other things. But there was something among the insanity that I felt was the last thing missing in my investigation. The true reason why we never returned to the Moon and why the Soviets never even attempted landing on it.\n\nAccording to that website, during the last moon expedition, in December of 1972, the astronauts were secretly instructed to find out what was causing the Lunar Transient Phenomena, and spent three days on the Taurus-Littrow Valley, the region where the phenomena was more frequent on the previous five years. They were carrying a seismometer, as the most influential theory at the time was that the LTP was being caused by moonquakes cracking the surface of the natural satellite and releasing gasses. \n\nBut what the seismometer detected was that there were no such thing as moonquakes. Their equipments revealed humongous structures, seemingly biological or mechanical, moving under the moon surface. \n\nOne day before they left, NASA detected an instance of LTP a few kilometers near where they were stationed, so the astronauts went there to check. What they found there was never disclosed, but some theorize they met one of the beings responsible for causing the blinking lights. And that was the reason humanity abandoned all expeditions to the moon. After five missions in three years, we never returned there.\n\n///20th of March, 2022\n\nI woke up feeling like my head was spinning. I was lying on the sofa of my motel room. Once again, I had spent the entire previous night and day reading texts cited by Dr. Hollfern. My tablet was out of battery, so I got up, feeling pain all over my body, and went looking for my charger. It took me a couple of minutes to notice the two men wearing dark suits, black ties and dark sunglasses sitting on my sofa. One of them had a silenced pistol on his hand.\n\n\u201cGood afternoon, Ezra Thornbridge.\u201d The one holding the firearm said, with a voice so ordinary it was scary.\n\n\u201cW-what?!\u201d I blurted, still trying to overcome the pain.\n\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t mind us. We are just here to recover something.\u201d The other man said, smiling.\n\n\u201cSomething that isn\u2019t yours, yet you\u2019re in possession of.\u201d The man with the gun complemented. \n\n\u201cI\u2026 Who are you?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cRight now, I\u2019m the man pointing the gun at you.\u201d The man with the weapon said, while his partner just shrugged.\n\n\u201cFine, I\u2019ll return your damn book. But I already know about it. I already put the pieces together.\"\n\n\"Oh, interesting. What do you think you know, Thornbridge?\" One of them mocked. \n\n\"The Solar Plexus Clown Glider. I have studied them in depth. Or do you prefer to call them like the Gnostic theologians called them back in the day? *Archons\u2026*\u201d\n\n\u201cLook what we have here, Spencer. Like father like son.\u201d The guy with the gun scoffed. \n\n\u201cI told you we should have just doped him and looked for the damn book while he slept. He is totally gone.\u201d Spencer said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not crazy! The Archons are real! They killed my father! They kill people! And you, instead of trying to protect the people, just hide their existence, just lie, just lie and lie and lie!\u201d \n\n\u201cHow can you be so smart yet so stupid?\u201d The guy with the gun said.\n\n\u201cThe Archons don\u2019t kill people, Ezra. They just make you miserable and drown you in fear and pain.\u201d Spencer said.\n\n\u201cBut I saw one kill my father.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour father died of chronic ventricular arrhythmia coupled with excessive alcohol ingestion. The thing you saw was merely an emotional parasite, feeding off his negative emotions and influencing him to indulge on them.\u201d Spencer said.\n\n\u201cDoes this mean\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. It also infected you that day. That\u2019s why you saw it. It\u2019s been with you ever since. The more you learn about it, the more you dread, the more you obsess, the more you lose\u2026 You were feeding it all along.\u201d Spencer explained.\n\n\u201cAnd why do you think we tried to protect you, dumbass? If the knowledge was harmless, we wouldn\u2019t be around breaking the law and breaking people\u2019s necks to prevent it from spreading.\u201d The guy with the weapon said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not too late, Ezra. When your father was alive, there wasn\u2019t much we could do, but now we have technology to make them go away. But it has a cost.\u201d Spencer explained.\n\n\u201cWhat cost?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will forget your father. You will forget most about the moon and astronomy. Probably the entirety of the last few months. And there are probable side effects, like sporadic short-term amnesia.\u201d Spencer said.\n\n\u201cOr we can just fucking shoot you in the forehead right now to prevent the thing from infecting more people. Your choice.\u201d The guy with the gun said. I just turned around and ran as fast as I can towards the window behind me. I jumped out of it, shattering the glass, and fell on the hard cold concrete of the parking lot. I tried to get up, my body was all cut from the glass, and I felt something warm on my back, even though it was raining.\n\n\u201cAre you stupid?!\u201d I heard the guy with the gun shouting while he and the other agent descended the staircase that led to the parking lot. I finally got up, feeling cold from the rain, and tried to run, but could only limp. Yeah, jumping out of the window like I was in an 80s action movie wasn\u2019t the best idea. I heard another click behind me, and fell to the floor. I could see the agents running towards me, smoke coming out of the gun. There seemed to be snakes around both of them, smiling witch their human faces and several sets of sharp fangs.\n\nI looked towards the sky. Among the raining clouds, I could see the moon above me, full and blooming. Blinking. Blinking so much.",
