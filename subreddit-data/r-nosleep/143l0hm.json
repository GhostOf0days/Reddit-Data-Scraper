    "postText": "In my life, I had a lot of unnerving nightmares like me being in a neighborhood completely alone, with no sound or cars parked somewhere; me going at home after school only to be met by a completely different house and the sound of birds chirping and the wind blowing stopping as soon as I saw it, etc. But this one. This one has left me so scarred that I still remember it as clear as day. I go to sleep at various times due to me being a phone addict, though that day I went to sleep at around 9 AM approximately.\r  \n\r  \nSo, let me explain the dream now. It started off with a stop-motion animation where there was a little girl (maybe 5 or 6) drawn in stickman fashion (everyone in the animation was drawn like that) standing on the road with a smile. Then, the scene shifted to a person in a coat walking quickly through the people in the sidewalk, almost like he was late for work or something. The scene shifted back to the girl, who had now crossed the road with a woman, her mom, looking at the person. She asked to her mom: \"Hey Mom, why is that man walking like that?\" The mother responded: \"I don't know, sweetie.\" The man then stopped right in front of the mother and child.\r  \n\r  \nHe looked at them with the most emotionless face possible. The child asked him: \"Hey, why are you looking at us like that?\" while the mother was keeping her daughter's hand tight. The man didn't respond, and after half a minute of silence, he took something from his pockets: from the left, he took a pistol. A motherfucking pistol, yeah. From the right, he took a bottle, or at least, that's what I thought it was. He shot the mother in the head in cold blood and threw the bottle: it wasn't an ordinary one. It was a Molotov cocktail. He threw it in the middle of the road.\r  \n\r  \nThe little girl, panicking, shook her mother who was bleeding from the front, muttering: \"Mom, why aren't you waking up?\" and screamed for help. Actually, everyone was screaming for help, because the man in the coat was starting to run at people with a knife and killing them, causing havoc. The sky turned a reddish orange, and the girl was trying to run away right when she bumped into the man. He killed her by tossing her in the flames caused by the Molotov. She screamed and whined and cried, but no one could help her. She died.\r  \n\r  \nThen, the animation ended and right after played something that I cannot get out of my mind anymore: some photos shifting really quickly of a real-life 5 year old girl's body burnt to a crisp. The last image was the girl's face. It wasn't ordinary, actually it was really uncanny: Her lower jaw was missing, her eyes gouged out, but the rest of the head was fine. Then, the background of the image became pitch black and the image's gamma was creaked by a lot, and now the eyes were white points looking straight into me. I cowardly stuttered: \"Hey, hey! We can calm down now, I didn't do anything to you!\"\r  \n\r  \nSome text appeared under the image, but I can't remember exactly what it was like. It was along the lines of: \"Oh, they threw me in a pit of fire and I shouldn't react like this?!\". Then, the nightmare ended and I woke up. The last image was burned in my memories: I can remember it almost exactly. It has been haunting me, and I swear I saw the girl sitting in my bed last night. Today I woke up to my bed being in flames. I am losing my sanity over one nightmare. If I don't post after this, I am either in a mental asylum, or I killed myself.",
