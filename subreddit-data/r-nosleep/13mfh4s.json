    "postText": "So I guess we will start at the beginning of March back in 2007, I had just moved back into my childhood home located at Hendrix, Washington. Last time I was at Hendrix before my move was in 1998 when I left for college and alot had changed since then. First there was a nuclear power plant on the outskirts of town, a town hall, and a statue of Mark J Hendrix (the founder of Hendrix), the population also doubled in size (went from 23,578 to 46,974).\n\nThe night it happened was 2 months later. I had just woke up and had went to get a cup of water. I grabbed a glass and turned on the sink to my horror the water was blackish brown. The water looked like water from the evil world in silent hill or at least what I imagined it would look like. The brown was on the outside and in the middle it was a deep black. It also smelled wierdly like rotten eggs. So I turned the water off and called the landlord but he didn't answer.\n\nSo I did the next best thing (I thought) and went outside. As soon as I opened my door I had a metallic taste in my mouth and I saw that my neighbor Alex was about to knock on my door.\n\n\"Hey um look Jamie can I come inside because my house smells like a gas leak and I have had a metallic taste in my mouth since I woke up.\",\n\nAs Alex helped me with my move I said yes and let him in. Alex looked to be in his early 50's with grey sleeked back hair and moustache, he was about 6'4. We sat in my living room for what seemed like hours but the calmness wouldn't stay forever. The metallic taste in my mouth was increasing every 30 minutes with that Alex looked sick. After awhile Alex look even worse and when he got up he immediately fell to the ground and started convulsing. I tried to help but my efforts were useless. Alex died in my living room that day.\n\nI called 911 but the line disconnected so I had to travel to the police station. On my way there I saw military and government helicopters flying next to the nuclear power plant with them was a giant plume of smoke. I was stopped in the road by a military soldier. He asked me to roll down my window so I did and this is what he said. \n\n\"Head to the police station as we are escorting civilians out of the town so go there now.\"\n\nAnd I'm writing this now as I remembered what happened last week and look Hendrix, Washington up and yet I found nothing not a single thing not even a location, it was like they wiped it off the face of the earth. Another disturbing thing was that ever since I swear there is a black SUV outside my house.",
