    "postText": "It had always been my dream to be a law enforcement officer. Since I was a small boy, I have always loved the idea of having a gun and catching bad guys all day. Hell, what kid didn't? While everyone was having an existential crisis straight out of high school, wondering what to do with the rest of their lives, I already figured that out when I was 9 and still playing with action figures. After graduation, I applied for the new York city police academy and after 6 months of physical and academic training, I was ready to patrol the streets of New York City.\n\n A few years into my law enforcement career, I can say without a doubt as most of us know by now: Reality is often disappointing. I had made my dream come true of becoming a police officer in a great city, but I guess I never considered I could be disappointed in that. I was severely under paid and overworked, I could barely afford a janitors closet to live in this fucking city, I couldn't keep a relationship to save my life and every time I put my uniform on it was like I was public enemy number one to every citizen. \nThe only thing keeping me from quitting my job and starting over was my partner, DeLeon. The only other thing that was consistent in my life Aside from the constant shit flow from this job was DeLeon. \n\nIn just a few short years, he had become like my older brother, giving me life guidance, inviting me to spend time with his wife and son, and always having my back.\nLast night, I was quieter than usual while on patrol, and I guess he saw the writing on the wall. \"Listen, kid, if you're unhappy with your place in life, you gotta do what makes you happy.\" I looked at him with a mix of shock and sadness I could feel burning on my face. \"That's clearly not police work,\" he said like he could literally read my mind, ofcourse I was an open book to him. \n\nBefore I had a chance to explain myself, a voice came over the radio. \"Unit 13, we have 10-62 in progress at westport,\" that was code for breaking and entering. My partner had already turned on our patrol lights and speed on when he said \"Well you did want some excitement,\" while grinning like a little kid behind the wheel. \"10-10 guardian, show us in route,\" I replied over the radio while I spot checked my equipment. \n\nIt took us about 15 minutes to get to the scene. The place was some abandoned warehouse scheduled to be demolished to make way for a new mall. The site was also secluded. We hadn't seen any cars, houses, or anyone for miles. \"Who the hell would want to break in here?\" I asked my partner, not really waiting on an answer. \"Better question is who called this in?\". DeLeon had a point.\n\n There was no one around or waiting for us when we got there. There were a few large trucks and demolition equipment just outside the warehouse, so there must've been a security guard posted somewhere. \"Keep your gun up and don't drop your guard,\" DeLeon ordered before we checked the area out. It was comically dark,the only light that illuminated our path were our flashlights and the distant full moon. It took forever, but we managed to find the main gate to the warehouse and a few feet next to it, a security guard post. I moved toward the guard post to see if anyone was inside. \n\n\"NYPD, we're responding to your call...\" I could smell it before I saw it. There was a familiar smell of iron in the air, but it wasn't until i peeked inside that I could make the connection. It was blood. The security guard was indeed inside, still sitting in his cheap chair. His face had been clawed off,barely resembling a face at all now, his lower jaw was nowhere in sight and only one brown eye remained,   it looked like it wanted to roll into the back of his skull.\n\n His insides had been hollowed out, and his one remaining arm had half its hand bitten off. There was blood and chunks of human flesh all over the small cabin. It looked like he had been mauled by a fucking bear but I've never seen anyone be so utterly destroyed. I couldn't stand the sight for more than a couple of seconds before I had to involuntarily throw up. DeLeon was only a few steps behind me before he saw the same thing I did. \n\nI could hear him gagging and moving away from the guard post. \"We better call this in.\" I couldn't agree more. Whatever was happening here and whatever killed that security guard, I wanted nothing to do with it. We started walking back to our vehicle, and I noticed it somehow had gotten even darker since we got to the scene. \n\nIt looked like clouds had covered the moonlight from shining down. Before I could even process what was going on something had violently tackled me to the ground, at first I thought it was whatever mauled the security guard but I could see that it was a man wearing ripped clothes. There was a brief struggle on the ground were the mother fucker tried to take a bite out of me. just as fast as I was on the ground DeLeon took out his tazer gun zapped away. I got underneath him and kicked him as hard as I could in the mouth. \n\nI took out my hand cuffs and put him under arrest. \"Do you think I just knocked out a potential witness?\" I asked jokingly trying to relieve some of the insane stress I was under. \"Whoever this fucker is he's coming with us.\" We picked the guy up and walked over a few feet to where we had parked only to find another unwanted surprise. \n\n  Our tires had been slashed in the amount of time we had been gone. I would've blamed our suspect but on the vehicles bonet there were 4 gashes that covered the whole of it's length. It didn't matter how maniacal you were, you weren't going to be able to do that with your bare hands.\nWe threw the unconscious suspect in the back of the vehicle and immediately tried to get backup on the radio. \" Guardian, 10-30, we need immediate assistance on scene, at least one dead person and suspect in custody. Our vehicle has been sabotaged and we are stranded.\" \n\nWe anxiously awaited a reply but nothing came. Only static. \"What the fuck do we do now?\" I said nearly panicked. \"Try to calm down, they know our location, if we don't report back they'll send in back up\" DeLeon said scanning the surrounding area in the dead of night. \"You shouldn't have kicked me in the face\" I jumped in my seat as I turned around and realized the suspect had regained consciousness and was leaning his face against the division cage. \n\n\"It wasn't personal, but now it is cop!\" The man was grinning so wide I could see he was actually drooling.  \"Did you kill that man out there you son of a bitch?\" I said trying to regain my composure. \"No. My friends did, but I'll make sure you get it worse.\" \n\nI was taken aback by this and felt my hand tightening against my holstered weapon. \"You got friends out here asshole?\" DeLeon cut in. \"Oh sure, and don't think I forgot about you zapping me either, you'll get yours too.\" \n\nDeLeon exited the vehicle and I immediately followed him out. \"What's our play here man?\" He opened the back of our patrol vehicle and pulled out a pair of shotguns from a duffel bag. \"We aren't gonna let those fuckers hunt us. Shoot whatever isn't friendly.\" As he tossed me one we both stopped in our track's. \n\nSomewhere in the distance we could hear a horrendous sound that I could only associate with some kind of roar. \"What the fuck is that?\" I gripped tightly on the shotgun and I readied myself. \"Something tells me it might be his friends.\" Suddenly we heard another roar, this one sounded closer but coming from a completely different direction. \"Oh Jesus, what the hell is that?!\" I took cover behind the vehicle.\n\n \"Whatever they are, their surrounding us.\" DeLeon was aiming in the direction where the last roar came from. My heart was racing. Even with the moonlight illuminating us again,we couldn't see 10 feet in front of us. We could hear whatever was out there now. They were close enough that we could make out the sounds of something large and fast quickly running from places we couldn't see in the darkness. \n\nSuddenly, I heard a loud, deafening gunshot coming from DeLeon's direction. I didn't know if he had gotten anything with the first shot but he kept firing, before I could join in something had smashed into him so hard and fast he flew through the air and landed several feet away from the cover of our vehicle. As soon as I saw him land, I sprinted toward him, shooting a few times in the direction I saw that black blur speed towards to. \"DeLeon, are you alright?!\" I asked while trying to get him off the ground. \"MY LEG!\" \n\nHe didn't need to say much more. Even in darkness, I could see he had landed terribly, and his leg was bent in a way it wasn't meant to. I handed DeLeon my shotgun as his had been thrown somewhere in the darkness, I got him up, and we could only get a few steps in before we hear another roar of whatever was hunting us. Before any of us could react, we were violently thrown in the air again. I managed to land close to the passenger side of the vehicle, DeLeon hadn't been so lucky. \n\nA few feet from me, what looked like a massive black warewolf dragging my partner across the ground... moments after it started ripping chunks out of him however way it could. It sliced into DeLeon's belly, and his intestines came spilling out. DeLeon was somehow still alive through all of that,trying to defend himself with one hand and trying to unholster his sidearm with the other. The warewolf bit unto his hand, taking all his digits off, then another warewolf joined in ravaging my partner. The only thing I could manage to do was jump inside the car and lock myself in as the two warewolfs finished ripping DeLeon apart. \n\n\"I told you we were going to get yours.\" I jumped as I had forgotten about the subject. Still, I'm custody. \"Shut the fuck up!\" I aimed my sidearm straight at the suspects head. \n\n\"I may not make it out of here tonight, but I'll make sure to empty this on your face first!\" My heart dropped to my stomach as I was pointing my weapon. As soon as the man leaned out of the darkness, he was lit by the moonlight and started laughing maniacally. Maniacal laughter turned into violent convulsions. He had started to go through a transformation. He broke free of the handcuffs, and his body started to grow,somehow outgrowing his own skin to the point I could see it ripping throughout his exposed body. His face had begun to morph into something out of the sickest person's nightmares. \n\nSomething inside his face was trying to explode out, so he used his claws to rip his own human face off, revealing a demonic warewolf that was still somehow grinning at me. Another warewolf had jumped on the car and was staring right at from the other side of the windshield, the other one had slowly peeked up from my passenger side window, both still stained in my partner's blood and now we're out for mine. Realizing how complete and utterly fucked I was, I started hyperventilating and in what seemed like unison all three werewolves attacked their respective sides. The first one to get through was the one by my passenger side window, it easily smashed through and immediately tried to bite my face off,it missed by a few inches, the only reason it didn't succeed in it's second attempt is because I fired a round right inside its mouth. This staggered it enough for me to uncomfortably slide over to the driver's seat. \n\nThe warewolf on the car bonet was quickly smashing through the windshield and desperately trying to bite or slash at me. The one still in custody was bitting his way through the metal cage and seemed to be the most anxious of all to get to me. I shot off a few more rounds to the one that was now apparently stuck halfway through the window space due to how massive it was. It didn't seem to hurt it at all. Maybe piss it off more. It was only a matter of time before they got to me, and having a bullet as a final meal was starting to sound like a good idea. \n\nI turned the barrel of my weapon to my lower jaw pointed up, I could still feel the heat emanating from it and the faint smell of gunpowder still in the air. I was about to pull the trigger when one of the werewolves, the one on top of the bonet and desperately reaching for me only seconds before,was thrown off violently off the car. Seconds after it was the one stuck in the window, it was pulled so hard back that chunks of flesh remained on the broken glass left. Lastly, the door to the back seats was ripped off, and something pulled the suspect that had turned into a hound from hell out. I was convinced I was going to be next, but nothing happened for the next few minutes. \n\nI heard the roars of those creatures somewhere in the dark,different now,sounding less powerful and frightening and more hurt and frightened. I want to say I was brave during the whole encounter but the truth is I was a nervous wreck, I spent the next eternity with my gun pointed at the darkness in front of me waiting for something worse than those werewolves to take me, I wouldn't have been able to shoot anything even if I tried with how much my hands were shaking. Maybe an hour passed when I saw the red and blue lights approach, I didn't really feel safe until fellow officers I barely recognized pulled me out of the destroyed patrol vehicle. The next few hour's were a complete blur, I remember getting medical attention at the scene, being taken into questioning for hour's trying to explain the fucked up events that had taken place that night. We have body cameras that are mandatory for all NYPD officer's to use while on duty so that should have been more than enough evidence to explain everything and clear my name. \n\nA few hours into waiting in a precinct interrogation room, a man holding a folder and who I've never met before comes in and sits down opposite me. \"I'm terribly sorry to have made you wait so long, Mr. Morales, I had to grab a few things from the boys at csi\" the man said with an accent I couldn't quite place. \"Look if you're going to ask me what happened again, save it. You've got my body cam footage. There's nothing else for me to say.\" \n\nI hung my head in defeat and expected him to berate me of the potential years of jail I could be facing. \"You mean the body camera footage that has been destroyed?\" I jumped my attention back at him. \"What the fuck are you talking about?\" He threw a folder at the middle of the table containing photographs of the crime scene. Our destroyed patrol vehicle, the dead security guard at his post, and a few random dismembered bodies, I thought I recognized one of the bodies using the same clothing as our suspect.\n\n \"I don't understand. What's going on here?\" I was tired, confused, and angry, and I had half a mind to punch the fancy dressed bastard in the mouth at this point. \" What's going on, Officer Morales? Is that you and your deceased partner encountered not one but three lycanthrope's last night. It's a very rare occurrence to survive an encounter with one, let alone three. \n\nAll evidence of last night's events has been confiscated and suppressed. The department will issue a statement of your partners death that will not involve supernatural creatures.\" I interrupted him as he was beginning another sentence.\"I've had a really stressful night, and I'm sorry, I don't think I've ever seen you in our department before, not that I'd care what your fucking name is or your hopes and dreams but you just barge in here and start telling me thing's that don't make a lick of fucking sense to me.\" I drop my head yet again in  indifference.\n\n \"All I want to know right now is, am I crazy or not.\" The man looked sympathetic although in a very robotic way. \"You're not crazy Mr. Morales. And as you most eloquently put it, you and I have never met. Consider me a liason between our two departments.\" \"What department?\" I asked, genuinely confused. \"The one you've just been transferred to.\"\n\n\nPart 2\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/146kubn/the_reunion/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button",
