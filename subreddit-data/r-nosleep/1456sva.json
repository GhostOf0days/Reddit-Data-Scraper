    "postText": "If you\u2019re reading this I am begging you to believe me. Especially if you have children. My name is Leon and I have been investigating strange disappearances for four years. I am not an official investigator or a journalist. Before I started this whole thing I did not believe in ghosts or the paranormal. For me to believe in something I had to see it with my own two eyes! Everything had to be factual and everything had an explanation. \r  \n\r  \nAt least this is what I used to believe until my wife was murdered four years ago. They found her at work completely skinless. She was drained of blood and was missing all of her nails. They told me the precision required to accomplish this was not heard of yet. I waited months for answers and they never came, so I decided to go get them myself. I had no idea where to start or who to speak to so I went back to the store to try and dig up as much information as I could find. \r  \n\r  \nHer manager eventually told me that she had gotten into a fight with a customer that day and that he assumed she went home on time. When her body was found in the employee break room he was shocked. He had no idea she was still in the building. He said he told me exactly what he told the police. I asked him if there was any footage of the man she was arguing with but he told me the security cameras were not working that day. I vividly remember wanting to punch this guy in his damn face. He was no help and I was determined to solve my wife's murder. \r  \n\r  \nI ended up searching for the guy for months. I asked every one of her coworkers if they saw the argument and a couple of times I even had a run-in with the cops. They insisted that I should let them do their jobs and that they had everything handled. There was no chance I was going to listen to them. I had to take time off from my investigation to attend her funeral and make sure I got all of the preparations right. In hindsight, I was not growing properly and I really should've taken some time to reassess. \r  \n\r  \nSo fast forward another month and I finally get a lead. Something I assumed the cops didn't have, this meant I could finally get some answers before being stonewalled again. I ended up finding this guy, Will Brookes at a fucken motel off of the highway about three miles from where my wife worked. I waited for two days before I saw him leave his room to get ice. Once I knew what room to find him in I knocked until he opened the door. He was rightfully pissed but not as pissed as I was. It took every ounce of willpower in my body to not kill him on the spot. \r  \n\r  \n\u201cWhy did you kill my wife?!\u201d I snapped as I forced myself into the room and slammed the door behind me. He looked shocked. \r  \n\r  \n\u201cI did not kill her!\u201d He screamed and tried to move around me. So I grabbed him by his shirt and slammed him into the wall next to the tv. This guy was not very heavy and not very strong. At that moment I was wondering how he could kill anyone. \r  \n\r  \n\u201cYou were the last person to be seen with her alive!\u201d I barked. I wanted to push his body through the wall. I wanted to crush him. \r  \n\r  \n\u201cI was bringing her the papers she requested for a job offer she accepted in a place called LittleBrooke!\u201d The man said. He was shaking so I put him down and pushed him to the side. \u201cShow me the papers,\u201d I demanded. My wife had told me twice that she had gotten a new job offer. I was extremely excited! I work from home and would be happy to live wherever she wanted. All she had to do was say the word and we could\u2019ve left as soon as possible. But she never made it home to tell me the news. \r  \n\r  \nI watched as the shaking man handed me a stack of papers and even a suitcase. \u201cHere, take it and please leave me alone!\u201d He shouted. \u201cOkay.\u201d I left the motel room and went right to my car. I put everything on the passenger seat and went home. Once I got there I sobbed in the driveway for over an hour before finally getting out and heading inside. I never got to see her body and I never got to say goodbye. Being in this house felt like I was walking into a damn shallow grave of sorts. \r  \n\r  \nI went right to the master bedroom and packed up as many clothes as I could. I even took some of her favorite items, I don\u2019t know why. I took a couple of pillows and two blankets, and after that, I went around to search the rest of the house. Once I had finished in the master bedroom I went and grabbed all my items from the bathroom. After that, I went into the nursery. We were planning on trying to have a baby once she got her new job. I looked around the nursery and took some stuffed animals and blankets, nothing too crazy. I also made sure to grab our family photo album. Finally, I made sure to grab all of the savings from the jar we had plus anything I kept in the safe. I also made sure to grab our wedding video and once I had everything I thought I could need I left the house. On my way out I made sure to tell the building goodbye. \r  \n\r\n\nOnce I got back into my car I decided to drive a bit. No way in hell was I going to the same motel as that guy so I drove until I hit a hotel far enough away from my house. I did not end up checking in though. Once I got close enough I backed up and just kept driving. I eventually hit a truck stop after a couple of hours and decided to rest my eyes for a while. I was exhausted and there were way too many questions rushing through my head. I knew if I kept driving in that state I would probably crash or something.   \nAfter sleeping for four hours I decided it was time to look through the papers and figure out what I was going to do next. I took the first paper from the stack and started to read it. For the sake of time here I will only tell you guys what I found that was interesting. \n\n**Paper One**: *You have been accepted to work as a store manager! Please review your employee packet for more information.* \r  \n\r  \nSo as I am going over this first paper a couple of things stick out to me. Whoever wrote this was trying not to be specific. The whole paper was one big announcement for a new store opening up in a place called LittleBrooke. There was no state mentioned anywhere on this paper, I would later find out that this place was supposed to be in Washington D.C. \r  \n\r  \nI decided to dig around and eventually found the employee packet. She accepted a job at a mega-store called BrightMarketZ. I thought it was a pretty weird name but what stood out to me was what they were offering to pay her. $22.00 an hour! I couldn't believe it. No wonder she said yes and didn\u2019t bother to ask any questions. \n\n\rPaper Twenty: To find LittleBrooke please enter \\[REDACTED\\] into your GPS device. You will be staying inside apartment 307. All rent for your first month in LittleBrooke is covered by your employer. Please note that all apartments are two-bedroom only. If you have a larger household please speak to Sydney May at Town Hall for bigger accommodations.   \nAfter reading this I decided to just go to LittleBrooke and get answers. I was assuming that I would find out what the hell happened if I just went. I wanted to know what my wife died for and I wanted to know why this was some big secret in the first place. I went back to bed and as soon as the sun came up I put the information into my GPS and headed for LittleBrooke.   \n\n\n# Year One in LittleBrooke\n\nIt took me three weeks to reach LittleBrooke and I could tell that something was wrong the moment I found the town. If I wasn't so damn desperate for answers I would've turned around as soon as I saw the library. The building itself wasn't big but the two huge lions on either side of the staircase gave me the creeps. \r  \n\r  \nAfter that I passed a mechanic, the whole place looked run down as hell. There wasn't a single car to be seen but the sign said open. The man standing outside of the building waved to me so I gave him a slow wave back. He looked weird. At the time I couldn\u2019t place my finger on why but now I know it\u2019s because he was not human. \r  \n\r  \nThe theater was kind of cool to look at in a vintage kind of way. They were not showing anything when I drove by and I made the decision early on to stay out of the theater altogether. After the theater, I saw a small building that said LittleBrooke Press. If anything else I figured I could write for the paper. \r  \n\r  \nAs I approached the apartment building a woman was standing outside. Her face was weird as hell. It looked like she had far too much plastic surgery like her face was threatening to pop at any moment. \u201cHi, can I help you?\u201d she asked me. Her voice was shrill, it was gross to even hear her speak. It sounded like she was putting on a fake voice just to speak to me. \u201cHi, my wife accepted a job offer. Unfortunately, she has passed away. I would still like to claim the apartment left to us. I can work at any place that currently has an opening.\u201d I offered. \r  \n\r  \n\u201cLittleBrooke Press has space for two more writers!\u201d She smiled and handed me the keys to the apartment. She never asked my name and she knew exactly where I wanted to go. I thought it was weird but I didn\u2019t argue. Instead, I took the keys and thanked her. I spent that whole day getting settled into the new apartment. A couple of things, the front door had four different locks on it. I thought that was pretty weird. I also did not see or hear any other people until my third night in the apartment. I called the LittleBrooke Press about a potential job and they told me to email my submissions. There was no need for me to come in person and honestly, I liked this deal a lot. \r  \n\r  \nFor the first few months, I spent my time writing about whatever came to my mind. After that, I would send it in and get my money back. The editor never told me what to do and they never requested anything. It was sweet. As December rolled around I could feel myself slipping into a seasonal depression. At that point, I had made no progress in any of my investigations. I did not know the town well enough and frankly, I felt like I was wasting my time. That night I decided to check out the local bar. It was pretty hidden, you had to drive further into LittleBrooke to find it. Once I got there I was shocked! The place was packed. I sat down at the bar and ordered a drink. \r  \n\r  \nThe bartender was hot as hell, too hot. She was so even looking so perfectly symmetrical that it made me extremely uncomfortable. There wasn\u2019t a single hair out of place. \u201cSo are you new in town?\u201d She asked me. \u201cYeah, I just got here a couple of months ago. My now-deceased wife accepted a job offer here.\u201d I said bluntly and dryly. I wanted to finish my drink and go. It was like the bones in my body were screaming at me to leave. The woman looked shocked. \u201cTell me, does that happen often? Do people accept a job offer in LittleBrooke and turn up dead a couple of days later?\u201d I hissed. It was a genuine question but she did not take it too kindly. She took my drink from my hands and told me to leave. \r  \n\r  \nAs I made my way back to my car I could hear someone coming up from behind me. I turned around as fast as possible and had to take three steps back. It was the bartender, but she did not look the same. Half of her face was weighed down like she had no bones at all. Her eyes were bulging out of her head. She gurgled at me. \u201cYou need to leave!\u201d She finally snapped and swung her arm in my direction. I moved back before she could hit me. As her hand hit my car window it shattered like it was made of ice. I watched as her arm popped and clicked. I could see it slowly getting longer. Before I knew it her arm was dragging on the pavement! She lunged at me so I punched her in her stomach. She gurgled again and sunk her teeth into my jacket. I screamed for help as we hit the pavement. She was trying fucken eat me! I grabbed her by her hair and threw her backward as hard as I could. As I scrambled to my feet and looked at her I screamed again. Her skin was pulled back. Now hugging the bones on her face. Her eyes were completely exposed! I turned and dove into my car as fast as I could. I slammed the door behind me and sped out of the parking lot like a bat out of hell. \r  \nThe next morning I received a letter under my door. \u201cSorry, you had problems last night! Please accept our sincerest apologies.\u201d -Mayor Brookes. There was $300 included with the letter. Now, I thought about leaving but decided I had to stay. Something was going on here and I had to find out what. I removed my jacket to see if the woman had injured me, she didn't but the experience was still terrifying. For the first time in a very long time, I was scared. But I also felt closer to the truth than I have ever been before. \r  \n\n\n# Year Two in LittleBrooke\n\nI spent all of January writing about the women who attacked me. I even contacted the police. I quickly learned that the police were going to be completely useless. My editor never sent the story back so I had assumed it was published. \r  \n\r  \nAt the end of the month, I left to shop for some supplies. Let me tell you, the grocery store in LittleBrooke is something else. They don\u2019t have any brands you\u2019ve ever heard of and at first, that drove me nuts. However, I quickly came to fall in love with the food here. It was comforting to have something to enjoy. Like always, I made sure to shop for two to three months at a time. Shopping was easy, I used the self-checkout to make sure I didn\u2019t have to speak to anyone. \r  \n\r  \nOnce I got home I put everything away and decided to look around the apartment building. My whole floor started with 301 and went all the way to 310. The first floor was 501 to 509. There was a technical second floor but none of the doors were labeled. It looked like someone was renovating the place. \r  \n\r  \nI got to see some of my neighbors too. An older woman, two men, and I were living next door to a lady the whole time. I had never seen or heard from these people before. It seemed like everyone wanted to keep to themselves too. I wanted to try and talk to someone but every time I approached them they turned and walked away. For what it's worth they looked completely normal. \r  \n\r  \nSo I left the apartment building and ventured around the property. There were no other apartments anywhere close to the one I was staying at, or so I thought until I found one about thirty minutes away. It was so out of the way you wouldn't find it unless you were looking. Against my better judgment, I opened the doors to the building and walked right inside. The place smelled like rust and soot. \r  \n\r  \nI went to explore the first floor and was shocked to find blood trails on the floor and the ceiling. I followed the trail and made sure to look at the numbers on each door. This floor was numbered 1-10. Most of the doors were locked and I wasn\u2019t going to try and knock anything down. I opened the door to apartment 10 and walked right inside. There was just enough light from the sun to illuminate the place. It looked like the whole place had been ransacked. I checked the tables and cabinets before heading into the bedroom. I searched the dresser and under the pillows before finally checking under the bed. When I looked under I spotted a black box. I grabbed it and that is when I got the feeling again. The hairs on the back of my neck stood up and I felt something sharp dig into my shoulders. \r  \n\r  \nI screamed as loudly as I could, my face slammed off of the carpet and I clenched the box with one hand. Before I could figure out what the hell was happening I was tossed backward. I went into the bedroom door and rolled a couple of times until I reached the torn-up couch. I slowly lifted my head and to my horror what I was looking at was way too far from human to be real. \r  \n\r  \nIt looked like a dog ape thing. It was mostly skinless aside from some skin on its torso and face. The creature had thick, long claws and was standing on its hind legs. It barked at me. Its fangs were huge! I quickly scrambled to my feet and rushed out of the door as fast as possible. I could feel the blood running down my back. Never once did I consider letting this box go. \r  \n\r  \n\u201cHelp!\u201d I screamed as I burst through the apartment complex doors and started to run back to the main road. My heart was pounding, I could feel my chest getting tighter with each step. I could hear the beast behind me, it was screeching. I thought I was going to die for sure, there was no way I could continue to outrun this beast. That\u2019s when I heard a car and before I knew it I could see it! A woman was waving me over, she was just up ahead! I had to push a little harder. I had to be just a little stronger. \r  \n\r  \nWhen I felt the embrace of the car door I ripped it open and dove inside. She sped away and I looked out of the window. The beast did not follow us any further. \u201cAre you insane!\u201d She snapped at me. That\u2019s the last thing I remember before passing out.\r  \n\r  \nWhen I woke up I was laying on my stomach on an extremely comfortable couch. I could smell someone making pasta with meat sauce. My stomach was going insane. Everything hurt though, especially my back and my left side. I figured I had hurt my side when I was tossed across the room. \r  \n\r  \nAt this point, I did not dive into the box yet. I could barely move. \u201cHi.\u201d I heard a woman say from the kitchen. \u201cThank you,\u201d I replied before trying to sit up. I was so concerned that this woman would be another monster. When I saw her though I knew she was normal. She didn't look so damn perfect and that was a breath of fresh air. \r  \n\r  \n\u201cWhat's your name?\u201d She asked me as I watched her prepare two bowls of food. \r  \n\r  \n\u201cLeon,\u201d I said before closing my eyes. \u201cYou heard me screaming?\u201d I asked her seriously.  \r  \n\r  \n\u201cI did. I\u2019m pretty sure everyone in our building did. You got hurt pretty badly, I did my best to patch you up.\u201d She paused and laughed. \u201cMy name is Ashley.\u201d \r  \n\r  \nSo I ended up crashing at her place. During this time I tried to focus on recovering. Sleeping became hell, I was having constant nightmares. I also spent a lot of time working on articles. I ended up giving Ash the keys to my apartment so she could get my laptop. It was a big move to trust anyone here but I am glad I did. \r  \n\n\n# Year Three and Four in LittleBrooke\n\nDuring my recovery, I spent most of my time writing. I wanted to write about everything I have seen and experienced. I had a lot of questions and way too much time with my thoughts. Ash and I got to know each other too. \r  \n\r  \nI told her about how my wife had died mysteriously. I eventually opened up about her being skinned and drained of her blood. Ash told me she had come to LittleBrooke with her older sister. Her sister went to work one day and never came back. She was working at the theater. Ash had told me that she was stuck here, she didn\u2019t feel right leaving with her sister still missing. Every time she would try the cops would meet her at the town line. \r  \n\r  \nIt was during this time that we both shared that we had never seen a police station. We talked about the monsters too. Her first run-in with one was at the grocery store. I told her about what happened to me at the bar. She told me that she heard rumors of the beast living beyond the apartments. The first time she saw it was when it was attacking me. \r  \n\r  \nAs I started to recover more we discussed a couple of things. First, the neighbors here suck. She could hear me screaming and came to help but no one else did. Second, neither of us has seen any families since we moved here. It was at this point I decided I wanted to leave and I offered to take her with me. We could both get out come hell or high water. She agreed but there was something I had to do first. \r  \n\r  \nI showed her the box I had taken from the apartment. \r  \n\r  \n\u201cYou almost died for a box?\u201d Ash asked me. \u201cYes,\u201d I said seriously. \r  \n\r  \nI opened it and blinked. I found a picture of a girl with black hair and bright green eyes. It read, Stephanie. I found a missing persons report too. This girl had been missing a year before I got here. I decided that my last article would be about her. I had written about a couple of missing people before this. For example, the old lady in our building vanished and her apartment was rented out two days later. \r  \n\r  \nI also found a badge inside the box. It read F.O.P.P. and there was a name! Jack Bridges. We tried to look up the organization's name but we came up empty-handed. I ended up writing the story about Stephanie and the next day Ash and I got packing. We decided to take my car since the cops know what hers looks like. I packed up the essentials all over again and we piled into the car. \r  \n\r  \n\u201cWe should check the other direction. Before we leave.\u201d I suggested. Ash knew about the bar already but neither of us knew what was beyond that point: This suggested changed the course of our lives forever. \r  \nSo we started driving in the other direction. We passed the bar where the woman had tried to eat me, we passed a convenience store I didn\u2019t know this town had and we just kept driving. Eventually, I could hear Ash speaking to me, \u201cHoly shit! The police station.\u201d she pointed out. I couldn\u2019t believe it either. I did not stop driving though but I wish I did. \r  \n\r  \nEventually, we saw a sign that read, LittleBrooke High. Go Bears! \r  \n\r  \nI started to slow down a bit until the school was in view. The place looked run down as hell. There were holes in the walls and leaves growing up the side of the building. The parking lot was massive and full of buses. I pulled the car into the parking lot and told Ash to get into the driver's seat. \r  \n\r  \n\u201cYou\u2019re not serious?\u201d She asked me. I could tell she wanted to go but I said, \u201cThis is it! This is the last place of note in this fucken town. Just take the wheel and I will be right back.\u201d I said as I jumped out of the car and went to look around. \r  \n\r  \nAs I approached one of the buses I grabbed the doors, they were already open a crack. I pulled them open and was hit with a horrible stench. I had to step back and puke and no I am not going to describe what I saw in that fucken bus. At that point, I decided I had seen enough and it was time to fucken go. \r  \n\r  \n\u201cHelp!\u201d I heard someone cry from a couple of buses over. \u201cPlease!\u201d I heard again. I wanted to slap myself because I knew better. I had already decided it was time to leave but I went to investigate anyway. I went to the bus and pulled the doors open. It smelled like stale piss and blood. \u201cBack here!\u201d A girl screamed out to me. I made my way to the back of the bus, stepping on school jackets and over backpacks. That is where I found them. Two teenagers are tied to the leg of a bus seat. They looked horrible, caking in blood and sweat. They were both injured. \u201cStephanie?!\u201d I exclaimed as I bent over to free them. I recognized her face the moment I saw it. \r  \n\r  \n\u201cCan you move? I asked the blonde girl.\u201d As I started to let her go. \u201cEverything hurts.\u201d She told me. I opened the emergency exit and called for Ash to pull the car over. It took her a second to hear me but she came as fast as possible. \u201cI am going to get you guys in the car and we are going to get out of here, okay?\u201d I told them. I wanted to tell them everything was going to be okay, but I couldn't. It felt like that would be a huge lie. \r  \n\r  \nAsh stepped out of the car and helped get the girls into the backseat. As I stopped to look around I could feel the bus shift in weight. I turned around and inhaled sharply. Standing before me was a creature wearing a jacket that said COACH on it. He looked sickly, and pale, and his veins were protruding from his face and hands. As he ran at me I jumped out of the emergency exit door just in time to feel something slam off of the back of my head. I looked down to see a barbed football. I could feel blood trickling down my neck, I stumbled forward and felt a hand grab my arm. Ash was shoving me into the car. She slid over me, closed the passenger door, and backed the car up. I thought she was moving like lightning. \r  \n\r  \nAt this point, everyone was screaming. My heart was threatening to jump out of my fucken chest. I was so sure we were all going to die here, just like everyone else I had seen on the buses. But no, Ash sped out of the parking lot. The coach chased us to the school limits but for some reason, he did not follow us anymore. \r  \n\r  \nI know we should've stopped to see if the kids could find their parents but we didn't. Instead, Ash just kept driving. Eventually, we could hear the cops behind us but that did not stop her. It took us six hours to finally see the You Are New Leaving LittleBrooke sign! I couldn\u2019t believe it. This place was not that big at all. \r  \n\r  \nSo listen, if you\u2019re invited to take a job in LittleBrooke. Don\u2019t take it. It\u2019s not worth your [life](https://www.reddit.com/r/SpectralsMegaverse/collection/a6e6a5d2-191a-4c91-a3ea-79fbfaf6275f). \r  \n",

You could drive the entire length of New Jersey, from Cape May to NYC, and back in that amount of time. Regardless, this town must be located in its own pocket dimension because it's much larger than Washington D.C.",

From Main Street to leaving LittleBrooke the time felt\u2026off. \n\nI say it\u2019s not very big because while in LittleBrooke you generally feel like everything is smaller. It\u2019s hard to describe. I am not familiar with  whatever a pocket dimension is but I will look into it.",
