    "postText": "[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/144dsir/always_respect_the_forest_when_you_go_camping/)\n\nIt\u2019s been a day, and still no sign of anyone coming by. I was really hoping to be writing this in the comfort of my home, but apparently there\u2019s other plans for me.\n\nI\u2019ve been out of food and water, it\u2019s all back at the campsite and I can\u2019t rightly go back there.\n\nI guess I\u2019ll keep on reliving what was going on, maybe that\u2019ll make time pass faster.\n\nIvy and I had dashed away into the woods, the late evening sun rushing through the trees alongside us. We heard the panicked yells and footfalls of our friends as they also fled, and we knew the ranger would likely be close behind us.\n\nAs fucked up as this is, I could only hope and pray that he\u2019d follow after them instead of us. \n\nWe ran for what felt like an hour, but from the lack of darkness, I know it couldn\u2019t have been that long. The sun was going down slowly, lazily, like it does in the summer. At least Ivy had killed the guy\u2019s ATV, he\u2019d have to follow on foot\u2026\n\nAlthough with how big the fucker was, his strides were probably long enough that was a negligible issue. Shit.\n\nWe stopped for a breather, the woods still eerily silent. We could no longer hear screams, or hurried footsteps. Just our breathing, trying as best we can to keep quiet.\n\nAfter some time, we started moving again, slower now. The light was starting to fade, and we decided our best course of action was to try and walk back to the cars and go get help. Of course, there was hardly any signal at the cars, and absolutely none once we got into the woods proper, but we hoped we could get through to 911, if nothing else.\n\nI looked to one side as I stood up, and on my left, I could see a phone flashlight cutting through the branches, bobbing with each step. From where it was being held, it likely wasn\u2019t tall enough to be the officer. I squinted, and once it got a bit closer, I could make out the distraught features of Greg, Jeremy\u2019s brother. His girlfriend, Loretta, was close behind. Both of them looked like they\u2019d been crying, which was\u2026 understandable, I guess.\n\nGreg looked at Ivy and I, squinting past his light. \u201cYou guys seen him?\u201d\n\nWe both shook our heads, and Loretta rolled her eyes. \u201cI told you we should just go, Greg.\u201d\n\nHe snapped his head back to her, a glare on his face. \u201cWe *all* need to get out of here, babe. I don\u2019t wanna leave anyone behind.\u201d\n\nBefore Loretta could respond, the sound of metal scraping on metal was heard, like in a movie when a knife is pulled from a sheath. I turned my head again, and saw the large, imposing figure of the ranger.\n\nHe stood about ten feet off, holding a hatchet in one hand. \u201cHey, there, kiddos. Using lights at night in the forest can really disturb the local flora and fauna of this here forest.\u201d\n\nWith that sentence that sounded straight out of a PSA, he Hurled the hatchet, the head of it finding purchase in Greg\u2019s thigh. He let out a scream and collapsed to the ground, holding the handle of the small axe as he writhed on the ground. The ranger grinned, the last few rays of sunlight illuminating his face enough to let us see his sick joy at the turn of events.\n\nLoretta screamed and bolted back in the way her and Greg had come, and he looked after her for only a moment, before looking at Ivy and I. \u201cGo on, get the hell out of here! Go!\u201d\n\nIvy hesitated for a moment, clearly wanting to help, but at the first footfall from the ranger, they nodded and took off, me following closely behind. As we took off, we could hear one last defiant shout from Greg.\n\n\u201cFucking do it then! You goddamn freak! DO IT! Fucking ki-\u201d\n\nThe word was cut off by the sound of impact on flesh, over and over. Eventually we ran far enough to escape the sound, and collapsed on the forest floor, breathing heavily.\n\nWe heard heavy footsteps treading, but not getting closer to us. They went parallel to us, eventually fading out into the night air.\n\nWe sat for about 20 minutes, listening for any sign of pursuit, or any sign of our friends. Right when we were about to get up and keep walking, we heard what sounded like a rope moving quickly? I can\u2019t quite think of the words to describe it. It was close, we ran towards the sound and in about five minutes we saw Luke hanging upside-down from a tree, his bag resting on the ground near his head. \n\nHe looked at us as we approached, and quickly started shouting for help. Ivy and I both tried to shush him, but he wouldn\u2019t listen, and we quickly heard the ranger making his way through the trees towards us again. \n\nLuke seemed to realize what was coming, and he started screaming louder. Not for help, now, though. For Adam, for his mother, for God, anyone who could maybe hear him and send some giant eagles his way, so to speak.\n\nThe ranger emerged from the brush again, looking at his newly caught quarry with another grin. His uniform was stained with splatters of blood now, although his face was clean. His hatchet was tucked into his belt, now, and he was carrying a small bag on his back. \n\n\u201cNow, in this here forest we practice catch, tag, and release. These here snares are for catching, now I\u2019ll tag, and then release.\u201d\n\nLuke tried to swing away from the man, but he reached behind the tree and pulled on a rope, and the snare gave suddenly, with Luke falling violently.\n\nDue to his momentum in trying to swing away from the man, he didn\u2019t land on his shoulder or have time to put his arms up to break his fall. He landed face first in the dirt, at a steep angle. His neck snapped, as did his back, and he folded over himself, his feet coming to rest near his head. His body gave one final shudder, and a wheezing, rattling gasp, before falling quiet.\n\nThe ranger cocked his head to one side, seemingly puzzled. I couldn\u2019t help but think of a meme Ivy had sent me before this trip, asking why animals cock their heads when they see something strange. \n\n*What, does it make more sense at a 45 degree angle, bud?*\n\nThe ranger coughed, still staring at Luke\u2019s body. \u201cWell. That, uh\u2026 Huh.\u201d\n\nHe looked genuinely surprised, before shrugging and walking towards us. \n\nIvy, who\u2019d been looking at Luke as well, a green tinge to their face, snapped their head up at the movement and bolted. I turned to watch them go, barely turning my head back to see the ranger swinging a fist at my head.\n\nI yelped and dropped to my knees, barely dodging the swing. He snarled and tried to grab my hair, but I was able to dart between his legs and kick at the back of his left knee. He grunted and stumbled as I felt around wildly in the dirt. A solid stick, a rock, surely something here could help me\u2026\n\nThe ranger stood back up, looming over me with a scowl. \u201cY\u2019know, in this here forest we do our best to keep the paths clear. You\u2019re not likely to find much that\u2019ll help you bash my skull in, miss.\u201d\n\nHe grabbed me by the shoulders and lifted me off the ground, dirt still between my fingers. Desperately, as he lifted me to his eye level, I ripped off his sunglasses with one hand, flinging dirt into his eyes with the other. \n\nThe ranger swore, dropping me and rubbing at his face. I took the opportunity and darted into the woods, in the general direction that I saw Ivy run.\n\n---\n\nBedding down again for the night. Like I said, there\u2019s barely any signal out here, all my calls have been dropping before they can get anywhere. Gonna try and conserve battery on my phone, keep my hazards on and hope that someone comes by.",
