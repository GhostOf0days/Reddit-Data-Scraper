    "postText": "If you've seen advertisements with a title similar to the title above, please do NOT click on them.\n\nI'm a middle-aged man who's currently living in Europe. A few months ago, I created a bank account in the States during a trip, as I needed it for business. Apparently, I needed a legitimate US address for that, but I do not own property in the States. I was actively searching for solutions, until I found one a few weeks ago.\n\nIt was an advertisement on Reddit, titled, \"Want a shareable address? Here's how to get one.\" That was EXACTLY what I wanted, and I was itching to try it out. It was a simple webpage, a minimally designed one. It prompted me to enter my address so my mail can be sent to my real address, and my phone number so I can be contacted if anything goes wrong. I wasn't a tech savvy man, and had no sense of danger, so I did the dumbest thing possible and actually entered the information. I completely fucked up.\n\nAt first, it was completely normal. I was assigned to the address 29 4th Avenue, and the US address is 16 Main Street. I received some bank statements and some advertisement leaflets. I went on with my life, working 24/7, doing boring shit for a living like the average human being. I received a couple strange calls on my phone though, but it wasn't really that suspicious. Or was it?\n\nThings started to get\u2026 weird a few days later. I received a handwritten note at my front door. \"Everything comes with a price.\", it read. It looks like an unfinished story, or maybe a composition for school, so I thought whoever wrote this must've accidentally dropped it. I ignored it.\n\nIt got even weirder. I received random horrifying images from a random guy on WhatsApp, including newspaper cuttings of missing people and murders. I was starting to get a bit concerned, figuring out what the fuck was going on.\n\nIt got so weird to the point of being absolutely terrifying. I received another letter, with drops of blood on it. It was sent by someone from 29 4th Avenue, which is the address I was assigned to. It only contained the words, \"You're next.\" What the fuck? What did I do? What \"price\" do I have to pay?\n\nToday, my curiosity has got the better of me. I had decided to get to the bottom of this, so I went to 29 4th Avenue and knocked on the door. The house looked uninhibited and old. It was identical to the haunted houses you'd see in movies.\n\nSuddenly, I saw someone staring at me from the windows. A chill went down my spine, and I turned over and sprinted home. I planted myself on the couch, panting, wondering what the fuck just happened.\n\nAs I was returning to my study just now, I received an image of my house from the same guy who DMed me the newspaper cuttings on WhatsApp. Then an image of my front door. He's getting closer. I heard footsteps. I panickedly locked my door and sat in my chair, trying to come up with an idea to get out of here. Finally, I heard my door open, and a ding that indicated I have received a new message. I pulled out my phone. He's behind me.\n\nI'm so done for.\n\nWant a shareable address? Here's how to get one.\n\n[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/someoneisbehindme/comments/148z2ul/third_story/)",
