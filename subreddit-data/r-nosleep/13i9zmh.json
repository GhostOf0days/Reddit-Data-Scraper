    "postText": "I never used to be scared of wasps. I was never a bug fan per say, but they definitely weren't on my nope list.\n\nFunny how much changes in a week, ain't it?\n\nMy opinion on wasps turned from ambivalent to aggressively negative about seven days ago. It was a sweltering summer day, and my friend, Jack, and I were trekking through the dense woods of Marathon County. The sun beat down on us mercilessly, and sweat dripped down our foreheads and backs. \n\nThe hiking trail was treacherous, with steep inclines and rocky terrain, but we were determined to reach our destination. Go hard or go home, Jack had said. Hiking wasn't really my bag, you know, but I could never really say no to him. We had been walking for what felt like hours, our legs aching and our throats parched, when we stumbled upon a small clearing.\n\nAs we stepped into the clearing, a sudden stillness enveloped us. The usual sounds of the woods, the chirping of birds and the rustling of leaves, had all but vanished. In their place was a deafening silence that made me feel uneasy. The air seemed thick with an unspoken tension, and I couldn't shake off the feeling that we were intruding upon something sacred.\n\nI scanned the clearing, searching for the source of my unease, and my gaze settled on the wasp's nest suspended from the singular branch of an otherwise limbless tree. \n\nIt was a peculiar sight, unlike any wasp's nest I had ever seen before. The nest was abnormally large, with intricate patterns etched into its papery surface. The wasps buzzed around it with a frenzied energy, darting in and out of the nest's open entrances.\n\nThe sight of it was mesmerizing, yet unnerving at the same time. It hung there like a giant, pulsating heart, its papery surface shimmering in the sunlight. The wasps' frenzied buzzing grew louder, almost as if they were trying to warn us away.\n\nBut it wasn't just the wasp's nest that made the clearing seem eerie. The trees surrounding it were twisted and gnarled, their branches reaching out like skeletal fingers. The grass beneath our feet was brown and withered, as if it had been drained of life. And in the distance, I could see a thick mist rising from the ground, obscuring everything beyond.\n\nI turned to Jack, and saw that he too was feeling the same sense of unease. We exchanged a wordless glance, both of us unsure of what to do next. Should we press on, or turn back? The decision hung heavy in the air, like a weight that we both shared. But as I looked back at the wasp's nest, I saw that the wasps had formed a circle around it, their buzzing growing louder and more insistent.\n\nIt was as if they were daring us to come closer. And I couldn't help but wonder, what would happen if we did? Apparently Jack had been wondering too, although - unfortunately - we came to different conclusions about how to proceed.\n \nJack, always fascinated by insects, approached the nest to get a better look. I cautioned him to stay back, but he was too entranced by the wasps' activity to heed my warning. As he drew closer, a single wasp flew out of the nest and stung him on the hand. A sharp cry of pain escaped his lips as he recoiled from the sting, frantically brushing the wasp away.\n\nI felt a pang of regret in my chest, knowing that I should have insisted we move on when we first saw the wasp's nest. I should have known better than to let Jack get so close to such a dangerous creature. But the regret was fleeting, quickly replaced by a sense of dread and unease.\n\nThe wasp's nest was not like any I had ever seen before. There was something otherworldly about it, something that sent shivers down my spine. I couldn't quite put my finger on what it was, but I knew that we needed to leave, and quickly. Jack's hand was already swelling from the sting, and I feared that there were more wasps lurking in the shadows, waiting to attack.\n\nWe hurried away from the clearing, our hearts pounding with fear and adrenaline. As we walked, I couldn't shake the feeling that we had stumbled upon something far more sinister than a simple wasp's nest. But I kept my thoughts to myself, not wanting to alarm Jack any further. We had to get out of the woods, and fast.\n\nAt first, Jack brushed off the wasp sting as nothing more than a minor inconvenience. We were on a hike, after all, and a few bites and stings were to be expected. But once we returned to our shared apartment and the days wore on, it became clear that something was wrong. \n\nIt started with a small bump on the back of Jack's hand, right where the wasp had stung him. We both noticed it, but neither of us were particularly concerned. However, over the course of the following week, the bump quickly grew into a grotesque, red, swollen lump that was hot to the touch. \n\nJack's skin around the sting site began to darken and take on a sickly purple hue. It looked almost as if the wasp's venom was spreading throughout his body like a poison, and the sight of it made my stomach turn. Jack complained of a burning sensation and intense itching that made him want to claw his own skin off. \n\nDespite my urgings, Jack adamantly refused to see a doctor. He insisted that he could handle it, that it was just a minor irritation and that it would go away on its own. But things only got worse from there.\n\nThe swelling continued to spread, taking over his hand and creeping up his arm. His fingers became stiff and immobile, and the skin was so tight it looked as if it might burst at any moment. \n\nI watched in horror as my friend slowly withered away before my eyes, his body becoming consumed by the venom of a single wasp sting. It was like something out of a horror movie, a grotesque and terrifying transformation that I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy - and it had barely gotten started.\n \nThe wasp sting on Jack's hand was a nightmare that refused to end. The lump continued to grow and fester, until it was the size of a golf ball. It was hard and painful to the touch, and Jack was unable to use his hand by the third or fourth day. He started to have fever and chills, and he was constantly scratching at the lump, as if trying to dig out whatever was causing this torment.\n\nI begged him to go see a doctor, but he was too afraid of what they might find. He was convinced that it would just go away on its own, that he could tough it out. But as the days went by, it was clear that the wasp sting was winning the battle.\n\nOne night, we were watching TV in our apartment when I noticed something strange. There were small, black dots on the surface of the lump. They looked like tiny holes, and I could see something moving inside them. I pointed it out to Jack, and he immediately panicked.\n\nAs we watched in horror, the holes grew larger and more numerous, until they covered the entire surface of the lump. The skin around them was red and inflamed, and it looked as if something was trying to claw its way out from inside. The smell was putrid, like rotting flesh, and it made my stomach turn.\n\nJack couldn't stop scratching at the lump, digging his fingernails into the holes and trying to pull out whatever was inside. But it only made things worse. The holes grew deeper and wider, until they were gaping wounds that oozed pus and blood. And still, whatever was inside refused to come out. I pulled my phone out to call an ambulance, but he snarled, slapping it out my hand and telling to \"stop being a pussy\".\n\nJack never usually spoke like that. I wish I hadn't been so shocked that I obeyed and sat back down \n\nJack's desperation had reached a fever pitch, and he was no longer thinking rationally. He clawed at the lump until the pain made him vomit, but furiously refused to let me call an ambulance. I could see the fear in his eyes as he realized that this was a situation  far beyond his control, and no amount of machismo could save him now.\n\nUnfortunately his epiphany came far, far too late.\n\nBefore Jack could form the words on his foaming lils, before he could U-Turn and beg me to call an ambulance after all, the lump began to pulsate and writhe, as if something was trying to break free from within. And then, to my utter disbelief and terror, I saw something crawling out of the holes in the lump. \n\nWasps. Dozens upon dozens of tiny, angry wasps.\n\nThey were tiny at first, their wings buzzing frantically as they struggled to escape the confines of Jack's flesh. But they quickly grew in size as wave after wave escaped Jack and flew around the room, their bodies still slick with his blood and pus.\n\nI felt a scream rise in my throat, but it was quickly cut off by the sight of some of the wasps returning to Jack and burrowing back into the holes in the lump. It was like watching a grotesque cycle of birth and death, as the wasps emerged from Jack's hand only to be swallowed up by the festering mass once again.\n\nThe smell in the room was putrid, a sickly sweet stench that made my eyes water and my stomach churn. The wasps continued to emerge and retreat from the lump, their buzzing wings filling the air with a low, ominous hum. And still, Jack couldn't express his regret that he'd refused to let me call for help, his eyes wild with fear and pain. For my part, I was too terrified to think rationally. It's easy reading this to say \"yeah nah that's when you'd call someone\". Not such an easy thing to do in the heightened emotions of the moment, believe me.\n\nI also wish the wasps were the end of it. They weren't though, not by a long shot. The lump swelled until it seemed as if it would burst at any moment. I could see the agony etched on Jack's face, his body writhing in pain and desperation. And all the while, the wasps continued to emerge and retreat, their bodies growing larger and more numerous with each passing minute.\n\nIt was a horror show, a grotesque and twisted nightmare that defied explanation. And yet, as I watched the wasps emerge from Jack's hand, I couldn't help but feel a sick sense of fascination. It was like watching a train wreck, something so horrific that I couldn't tear my eyes away.\n\nAs I stood there in helpless horror, Jack's screams grew louder and more desperate. I looked on in utter disbelief as more and more wasps, one by one, began to crawl out of his skin. At first - in my shock - I kept reassuring Jack that it was just a few, and I thought that maybe we could brush them off and everything would be okay. But as the minutes ticked by and more and more wasps emerged I couldn't even manage deluded platitudes.\n\nThe air around us became thick with the buzzing of wings as the wasps poured out of Jack's body. Spasming now, jibbering non-words like he was having a stroke, his body convulsing as he tried to rid himself of the biting, stinging insects. I wanted to help him, to do something, anything, but fear rooted me to the spot. I couldn't move, couldn't even speak.\n\nAnd then, the transformation began.\n\nJack's skin, which had been purpled and bruised just moments before, began to change. It turned a sickly yellow color, and I could see it becoming hard and shiny, like the surface of a wasp's nest. It was as if his skin was turning into a shell, a cocoon, trapping him inside.\n\nAs the transformation progressed, more and more wasps crawled out of his skin. They were covered in pus and other bodily fluids, and they looked as if they were ready to feast on my friend's flesh. I could hear the sound of their tiny mandibles chomping away, tearing at his skin and muscles.\n\nBut it wasn't just the wasps that were changing Jack's body. His limbs were shrivelling, and his fingers were becoming empty and flat. His face ballooned, his eyes bulging out of their sockets as his nose and mouth flattened under the pressure of the mass of insects swarming inside him.\n\nThe buzzing grew louder, and I could see the wasps crawling just beneath the surface of Jack's skin. They were everywhere, filling every part of his body, as if they were building a nest inside him.\n\nI was paralyzed with fear and disbelief as my friend Jack was cored and turned to mulch from the inside out, his choked screams now muffled and gagged by the writhing mass of buzzing insects filling his throat and chest cavity. The sheer volume of wasps crawling out of his body had all but buried him, covering him in a thick, writhing blanket of black and yellow.\n\nI wanted to run, to get away from this nightmare, but I couldn't leave Jack behind. He was my friend, and I couldn't abandon him to this fate. So, I stood rooted to the spot, watching as he transformed into a living wasp hive before my very eyes.\n\nThe wasps continued to pour out of his body, filling the room with their angry buzzing. Their wings beat in a frenzied rhythm, the sound like a thousand tiny drums pounding in my ears. I could see their stingers glinting in the dim light, and I knew that I had to get out of there before they turned on me.\n\nAs the wasps emerged from the thing that a week ago had been Jack, I could see that they were covered in pus and other bodily fluids. They were like a living disease, spreading their infection throughout his body, consuming him from the inside out. I could see the wounds on his skin, the places where the wasps had burrowed into his flesh, and I knew that there was no hope for him now.\n\nThe transformation was not just physical but mental too. Jack's screams had turned into a high-pitched buzzing, and his eyes had become black and glossy. His skin was no longer flesh but tough, shiny armor, like the surface of a wasp's nest. The wasps continued to crawl out of him, filling the room with their angry buzzing. I could see their mandibles chomping away at his flesh, tearing it apart with ease.\n\nJack's body was no longer his own, but a breeding ground for these vicious insects. And as the wasps swarmed around us, I knew that I had to get out of there before they turned their attention to me.\n\nThe air was thick with the scent of sweat and fear, and I could feel my heart pounding in my chest. I knew that I had to move, had to get away while I still had the chance.\n\nI took a step back, trying to put some distance between myself and the wasps, but it was too late. They had already spotted me, and they were coming for me with a vengeance.\n\nI turned and ran, my heart pounding in my chest as I fled the room. The sound of the buzzing was deafening, and I could feel their wings beating against my skin, the flashes and flares of white hot pain as the first stingers found me.\n\nI burst through the door, slamming it shut behind me, and ran down the hallway, trying to put as much distance between myself and the wasps as possible. I could feel them scratching and biting at the back of my neck, and I knew that I had to keep running if I wanted to survive.\n\nTheir buzzing grew louder and more persistent with rattling breath from my panicked lungs. I could see their shadows flickering on the walls, and I knew that the bulk of the swarm was getting closer.\n\nI pushed myself harder, my muscles burning with the effort, and finally burst through the front door. I ran for what felt like hours, my mind spinning. I couldn't believe what I had just witnessed, and I didn't know what to do next. All I could think about was the fact that Jack was gone, replaced by a swarm of vicious wasps that had taken over his body and turned him into a living nest.\n\nI managed to calm down after a few hours, but when I went back to try and see if I was going mad or not, but the area was cordoned off by shady looking CIA-looking spooks. Scientists and researchers descended on our apartment, desperate to study the living wasp nest that used to be Jack.\n\nThey've cordoned off our street, and I'm writing this from an Internet cafe. Please, if you're reading this, stay away from any strange wasp nests you find. I've still got to work out what I'm going to tell Jack's Mom.",
