    "postText": "\n\n\n\nMy name is unspokable by human but you can call me 'omega john' im an alter of the GUY named john, what is alter you may ask, well in this universe there is 5 wall, and your universe is the middle of it, I'm an alter, like my name suggest im an alternate version of John from your universe, I'm from the fifth wall and our job is to protect other wall and your universe that we call 'the xore', from the outer universe that called  'paradoximania', well alter will usually being called by you human as the 'dopelganger' or alien, whatever... \n\nJust remember, we don't always successfully defending all of the Wall, that means there is some 'paradoximania' creature already has break into all of the wall and already inside your universe, we call it 'morphdox' because it could morph itself into almost anything, it could be your parents or your best friend, and the people it morphed into.... \n\nLet me say it in two worlds 'mash potato'\n.....\n\nI know it sounds pretty ridiculous, but we believe that there is a a device in your universe that named 'energy manipulation, and kinetic morphing device' or shortly 'ENMANOVICE', what can this device do is that it can manipulate morphdox morphing ability and make it morph into anything we want, but remember there is the demon that has mouth with a sharp teeth,it has a pretty distorted face, It has no eye, it is blind obviously, but once it gain the device he could gain his eye back, and all of 5 walls and the 'xore' will be destroyed,So please find the device-communication end\n\n\nWe met again, listen you may wonder 'why dont you find the device yourself', well, we cant go into your universe because we could turn insane inside your universe or even worse, explode. So then let me narrate what happen.and how do i can narrate all of this,let me tell it in a simple way,our ability is beyond your knowledge as a fith wall entity but our brain is still weak when we get into your universe or xore, that's why I maybe will say something that normal people normally shouldn't know like another people thoughts and action like this boy, james he is very important, but I cant explain it now \n\nIts monday, one of the most hated day for james,but he dont realize that this day will be worser than he expected..... \n\n\nJames walk down the stair after changing his clothes to his school uniform, he wake up pretty late, 'hey mom, whats for breakfast'. 'cereal, eat faster, the bus will arrive soon', 'dont worry mom, you know im the fastest cereal eater right?' right after he finished a bowl of cereal, the bus school arrived, he quickly go wash his hand and mouth and running to get to the bus, after getting in the bus, he sit on his regular spot next to his friends, kevin.' hey kevin, how is your day'ask james.'fine,how about you' ask kevin back. 'i wake up pretty late but i still could eat a bowl of cereal because you know im the fastest cereal eater right', they're both then laught at the james, joking about his record of beating everyone in eating cereal the fastest.\n\nright at 9:00 am, theyre arrive at the school, they has a math class at the morning, after that class, they had a science class, at the time of recess, james go to the toilet to poop, you know,when he is inside the toilet stall, he hear some one knocking on the door stall, he pretty shocked then say 'already occupied' loudly, but suddenly he hear someone laught, a twisted laught, something isn't right,the person that was infront of the door stall then bang the door very hard, telling james to open the door, 'don't you want to play?' say the him,because his voice is like a man, james then started shouting, the teacher that coincidentally walk in the hallways that near the toilet, hear james screaming in the toilet and rushing in, james then hear something like a glass Shattered into a pieces, and something very big hit the door stall like very strong, the door almost shattered into pieces, after a while, the teacher then called james, telling him it's safe for him to get out now, he then get out and find some tall man laying on the floor with his head shattered and full of the a piece of shattered glass, the teacher then tell james to get back into the class, he did and run away into the class, james is traumatized by what happening to him, he being silent for the rest of day, when he about to take a bus to go home, he see a police car, parked outside the school, he knows why the police is here, he being very silent in the bus, not like usual, kevin even ask him 'are you okay?, you seems worried by something, you can tell me your problem, I'm your best friends' ask kevin, 'nothing, it just i having a stomachache from the canteen pudding you know' Answer james, 'but..you don't see like....' 'no, nothing else just stomachache, can we don't talk about this' say james after Cutting the kevin word, kevin and James being silent in the bus.\n\nAt home, james is so surprised to see a cops car in front of his house, he scared something bad might happen, but after he get in, his parent explained why the police here, it's about the man in the toilet, the police say 'it just some pedophile, he somehow get into the school, don't worry he under arrest now.' say the officer. 'you lucky the teacher save you that time' said his mom. After a long discussion, Jame feeling so sleepy and tired and decide to take a nap earlier, \n\nAt 11:23 pm, james woken up by the sound of the glass shattered, he think that there might be a robber in his house, he quickly sneakily get into his parent bedroom that just next to his room, he knocked the door, but nobody answered, he try to open the door... \n\n'it's unlocked, that's weird.' \n\n\nIn there, he shocked to see a window in his parent bedroom is shattered into a pieces and his parents is nowhere to be found, he then turn on a light just to see something horrifying\n\nSomeone eyeball on the floor\n\nHe almost puked when he see it, but then something knock on his bedroom door very loud, he can hear it inside his parents bedroom, he knows it's not his parent so he get out throught the window to hide at outside for a while, he lucky it isn't raining tonight, he then hear something destroyed his bedroom door, and then a footstep, after a while, the footstep slowly fade away and he get back in, he go to downstairs to call the police but on the way he get down, he see his parents hanged upside down, they weren't awake, the telephone is behind his parents, he could see that his mom lost one eye. \n\nHe then remembered about the eyeball in his parent bedroom, he then go get the phone but when he turned back he see some gore scene that gonna terrify him forever, his parent back is like a crab with his back being drilled by some big drill and the rib cage is like spread out to form some kind of mouth but it has ribcage as a teeth and there some thing like egg inside it, he dont even call the police, he just straight up run to the front door, but when he open the front door, he see some big tall figure, it has a pretty distorted face but after a few second, the creature morph into james, james is very confused by this, but when he turned back to run away, he see his parent in perfect condition, not hanged anymore, no holes, they're perfect, but the smile it's unexplainable. \n\nThe james doppelganger then say, 'your heart is the way to serve our lord, may he get his eye back' the doppelganger then hold james from behind while his parents morph their hand into something creepy, like a knife, james know what they're doing, they want to take his heart for some ritual, but then the police officer from earlier came and save james, his head is bleeding a little bit and his hand is bandaged, he blind the creature with the bright flashlight that he brings from the place he locked, a basement, it seems like this creature trap this police officer inside the basement because he appear from the basement, he then grab james and bring him into his car and get away from there, james then asked what is happening, the officer answered 'you better don't know it kid' \nThe officer then drive the car and bring james away from that terrifying house, \n\nAnd if you wonder what happen to james, don't worry, he save with me, do you know the officer names? \n\n\nHis name is john\n\nMy alter at earth",
