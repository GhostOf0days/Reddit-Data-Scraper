    "postText": "When I was younger my grandfather would tell stories about a lost ship. The story would go along the lines of how my grandfather was apart of a team sent to find this ship called the Windaver, the team would go off the coast of North Carolina to find this ship. I forget the rest but that is how the premise was of the story. I was close to him growing up but he was always paranoid around water so when I move to Holdan Beach, NC we grew apart. \n\nHe died 2 years after I moved due to a self inflicted gunshot wound. Nobody in the family knows why he did it, not even his wife (my grandmother). He also left everything to me, what's weird about it is he changed his will the day before he died. When I went through his stuff I found a document from 1975 around the time his ghost ship story would take place, so of course I read the document and it talk about the ship (Windaver), the team (including my grandfather), and where to look for the ship.\n\nAfter a week of thinking I decided to try and find the Windaver. It took another week to find someone willing to take me to look for it, the persons name was Ben. Ben did warn me that he would take me for only a hour then he would drive back to shore, unless we found it of course. Ben was tall, skinny and had long black hair, he was 6'4 and looked like he weighed 212-234 I couldn't tell, he looked like he was in his late 40's to early 50's.\n\nOn June 19th 2019 we went out to find the ship. It took only 47 minutes to find the rusted, slimy, old ship through the fog that day. The ship was big yacht about 2 times bigger than Ben's boat, with algae all over the side, the hull of the ship was rusted, with the letters Widae on the side and the nvr in the name only having outlines of where they once where. Ben was to scared to get on the boat so he stayed on his as I got on the Windaver.\n\nAnd a good thing to as the ship was one step away from collapsing in on itself. I found that the only way forward thought the ship was below deck. When I went down below the deck I found a skeleton with withered clothes sitting on a wooden chair at a desk that is collapsing. In his hand was a journal. What was inside is what made me regret coming on the ship at all.\n\nOn the first page it had a list of the crew of the ship. Alexander Von Cross the captain, Jamie Westlin engineer, Deven Haley first officer, Gerald Pince basic crewman, Paul U. Viddic navigator. When I read the last name it sounded familiar like a old friend or family, then it hit me that was my grandfathers name. Which seemed impossible at the time as he was apart of the team to save them. I continued reading the journal and it was normal for the first 7 pages the 8th page it when it went down hill. \n\n\" The day was normal until we had a meeting with the captain, the meeting was out of the blue for all of us. Hell I was still doing my navigation at the time when it was called. The crew was joking as we waited for the captain to speak, not for long though. The captain stood up and stated this message. ' I can't believe I'm telling you this but I'm feeling guilty so here we go, I have made a deal with the devil that if I brought you out here and left you here I would get extreme wealth, but then today he added a extra bit. That a demon serpent would come and kill you all, I cut the deal off as I realized the mistake I was making but now it will kill all of us. The bad thing is that it comes tonight.' Of course we all thought that this was a joke but he was dead serious. So I've been praying ever since hoping that I will live so I can see my girlfriend as I still need to put a ring on her. I will also be putting this on a desk below deck, hoping Jamie finds it first as he is just a kid and I'm going to send him down here. PS there will be a gun under it for you Jamie so you don't suffer I'll pray for your forgiveness.\"\n\nAfter reading that passage I looked at the skeleton and saw a gun in it's hand and a hole in its head. I felt something touch me and heard a voice say \"leave here now grandson.\" After I heard that I bolted out from below deck and into Ben's boat. I yelled at him to drive off so he did thankfully. As we pulled off I saw a serpent like shadow creature come from below deck. It was what killed the crew except my grandfather. Now 4 years later I see this serpent in the corner of my eyes in my house. It followed me home, and now as I type it is getting closer to me. My name is Allen Viddic and this is my good-bye.",
