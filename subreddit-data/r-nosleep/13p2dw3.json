    "postText": "A couple days ago Elijah Carter, Kit Sutton, Nettie Peterson and I got together for lunch to figure out what had been happening to me. I was slightly uncomfortable being fussed about like that. Not that I'm not used to it, considering who had been my guardian for the majority of my life on earth. Eli had been a bit tricky to get a hold of because of his work, and it was much the same with my savior human, but they all made it clear they were eager to help. \n\nWe met up at Tom's Diner after the lunchtime rush was over, the four of us sitting down together in the corner booth Nettie and I favored. Rhonda swung by only to recognize me and turn on her heel with a wide grin. \"Fran, your wife is here!\" she hollered, and I could hear the clatter of dishes and hushed curses from the kitchen. Frankie Preston came striding out of the back with murder in his eyes, hissing something at the other waitress who only laughed out loud in response. \n\nWhen he arrived at our table, he squared his shoulders and gave a sardonic smile. \"Hey, Sunshine. Sorry about that. I'm the only young man in a place full of ladies in their fifties and forties. It's like I've got six mothers and they all love embarrassing me.\"\n\n\"It's okay,\" I told him.\n\n\"This a special occasion or something?\" \n\n\"Yeah,\" Kit piped up. \"And you can contribute, actually. Do you have time?\"\n\nHe shrugged, looking around. \"Give me your orders first.\"\n\nSo we did. When he was gone, Nettie leaned over to me, her brows knitted. \"Something I should know?\"\n\nI gave her a nervous smile, avoiding her scrutiny. Kit answered in my stead. \"Oh for crying out loud,\" she hissed, tugging on my best friend's sleeve which prompted her to fall back into her seat. \"He and Eva are\u2026 friends. You can relax, we actually hung out together and he's alright. He's nice, actually. He only looks creepy.\"\n\nNettie huffed. \"Whatever,\" she said to Kit. \"But it's great to hear it from *you* and not her. I don't feel like an evil governess at all.\"\n\n\"You're not,\" I told her. \"But you were so apprehensive of him\u2026\"\n\n\"I was only worried!\"\n\n\"How about you two sort this out later?\" Eli Carter chimed in, putting an end to that particular discussion. Frankie returned not long after and Kit told him to \"get in here\", so we all awkwardly scooted around until he was sitting beside me. We explained briefly why we had come together and he nodded along, the bubble he was blowing from his gum getting bigger and bigger until I reached over to pop it. \"I see,\" he began, sucking the pink remnants back into his mouth. \"I think we oughta look for similarities, then. Between the three times she's switched locations.\"\n\n\"Four times,\" I said quietly. \"There were four times, technically. The first one was five years ago; how I ended up here\u2026\" My throat had gone dry and Nettie grasped my hand. \n\n\"She fell from the sky during a solar eclipse,\" she added. \"Don't know if that last part has anything to do with it but considering the cosmic scale of the event, it might be worth mentioning.\"\n\n\"I'll say,\" Frankie replied, throwing me an astonished look. \"You're like something out of a Bowie song.\"\n\n\"There was nothing lyrical about it,\" I muttered. \"I only came here because my home got\u2026 swallowed. Eaten. I'm the only survivor as far as I know. I don't have a clue how I managed to cross over, or why my body changed when I did. And it hasn't happened again until now.\"\n\n\"Then Kit and I were with you the second time,\" Elijah supplied. \"When you were hiding in the slide. Did you notice anything there? How exactly did it happen, could you pinpoint any possible trigger?\" \n\nI shook my head no. \"It had started before I even knew what was going on. I was feeling all tied up and compressed, and then there I was, at this strange beach-place. I sat there for a while until I noticed something creepy in the sky, and then I popped back out.\"\n\nEli rolled his lips together. \"That's neither here nor there. But I didn't catch anything odd either.\" He glanced over at Kit, who merely shook her head. \n\n\"The third time, I was swimming with Frankie. Or trying to, at least. And again, it simply *happened*, one second we were there, and in the next, everything around us had changed,\" I continued.\n\nFrankie nodded. \"It was this weird, creepier version of the pool. Then that monster came and lifted us out of the water; Eva kicked its ass and we started falling. We just materialized in mid-air in this dimension. Made a huge splash, too.\"\n\n\"So you reappear in almost the exact same place you left on this side,\" Nettie observed. \"That tracks with the tumble we took on the fire escape.\" She gave the group a short run-down of the events at the warehouse, leaving the other three gaping.\n\n\"Woah,\" Elijah put it eloquently. \"Hold up. You say you ran into a crime scene?\"\n\n\"Yeah. There'd been a decapitation. I'm sure of it,\" my savior human explained. \"There was a guy cleaning up, and something round was lying there and\u2014\" She stopped talking when Kit gagged.\n\n\"Fuck,\" Eli murmured. His coffee mug was trembling in his large hands. \"And you didn't call the police?\"\n\n\"We had something to do with those same people,\" I argued. \"We took money from them; do you really want the police around?\"\n\n\"Hell, I was on the force, Shirley. I'm on your side; I'm glad you didn't. D-don't ask.\" Elijah buried his face in his palm, leaning over the table. \"Fuck,\" he repeated in a low voice. \"It's the Collective, isn't it? The ones who paid us.\"\n\n\"You don't need to make this your problem, do you?\" Frankie asked, scooting a little closer to me on the bench. \"Stay out of their business. You don't want to have a bunch of freaks coming after you because you've pissed them off; you can trust me on that one.\"\n\n\"Oh yeah?\" Nettie eyed him suspiciously.\n\n\"Take my word for it. Ugh, stop looking at me in that *what are your intentions with my daughter*-kind of way; I'm getting nervous.\" He shifted in his seat. \n\n\"You keep getting transported to these twisted versions of the real life places, don't you?\" Elijah pondered. \"The pool, the staircase\u2026 the beach makes sense, too. The playground is built entirely in sand. That's kind of a pattern, isn't it? Except for when you fell to earth. But that's different anyhow. Your whole body changed then, and you never teleported back to your old world.\"\n\nI nodded slowly. \"I guess so.\"\n\n\"So these incidents are all random?\" Kit asked. \"Because it doesn't sound like there's any common ground, actually. In *how* you switch places.\"\n\n\"I might be flattering myself, but I think there is,\" Frankie chimed in. \"If two conditions apply. First, Sunshine, are you comfy in tightly enclosed spaces?\" \n\n\"I've never really been in one for long.\"\n\n\"Never? You didn't, say, get stuck in an elevator or locked in a restroom stall at any point in your life?\"\n\n\"No. What are you getting at?\"\n\n\"I believe that what you thought was the start of your transportation to the other side back in the tube slide was actually a panic attack. You were hiding in there, your legs were starting to cramp and some part of your brain was introduced to the wonderful world of claustrophobia. It would make sense, too, because all the other times, you didn't feel anything during the quote un-quote *journey*, you just disappeared in one place and popped up in another.\" He was talking so excitedly I could see the gum bobbing up and down behind his teeth. \"If I'm right, then there's your connection. You hop dimensions whenever your flight-instinct kicks in. Before you fell to earth, you were about to be killed, and you had just seen a lopped off head when you and Miss Peterson landed in that dark staircase-place.\"\n\n\"What about the pool-incident?\" Kit inquired.\n\n\"That's where I'd be flattering myself.\" Frankie paused, then very slowly turned his head to face me, golden curls framing a quizzical expression that turned smug when I couldn't hold his gaze. I remembered the way he'd held me, surrounded by cold water. His warm gaze on me. The pinpricks, and how my throat had gone dry.\n\n\"Well, Sunshine?\" His voice brought me back into the present.\n\n\"You are right.\" It had been panic, plain and simple. A different kind maybe than the other times, but somehow no less intense.\n\nHe let out a tiny gasp that turned into a smile.\n\n\"There you go, anyways.\" I couldn't seem to keep my hands still. \"You got the right impression. But don't\u2026 *needle* me about it.\"\n\nHe stayed silent for a beat. \"We should talk this out sometime. Not now, obviously. But just because I tease you doesn't mean I don't\u2014here I go with my double negative; I'm such a pessimist. What I mean is, I wind you up because I think you're very cute when you're flustered.\"\n\nI snapped my head around to him, but he wouldn't face me, staring off into the general direction of the counter with a faint smile on his lips. He then brought his palm flat down on the table with a smack. \"I should get back to it. Happy to help or whatever. One more thing, though. Kit, my boss wants to know if you'd play here once or twice a week. He saw you at the beach and thought you were marvelous for some reason. I'll text Eva his contacts for you. Be off.\"\n\n\"Huh,\" Nettie murmured, gazing after him as he flitted away. \n\nKit was over the moon. She hurried to set up an arrangement with Frankie's aforementioned employer, who according to her sounded very, very odd on the phone. Now that I think about it, I have never seen the man. Anyways, yesterday my roommate had her debut at the diner. Nettie and I had come to watch and support her, and apparently, so had quite a few others. Her performance at the beach had left an impression with the townsfolk. We sat down in the same booth as before, facing the corner that had been cleared out for Kit Sutton's setup. She'd taken her scratched-up electric guitar and amp, which she'd made an effort to clean for the occasion. I was surprised that the century-old layer of dust had come off at all, but it explained the muffled curses I'd heard the night before.\n\nFrankie was lingering by our booth, stalling before he'd have to go and announce my roommate to the diner. \n\n\"You don't like Kit's music very much, do you?\" Nettie Peterson asked him.\n\n\"He doesn't like much of anything,\" I replied in his stead.\n\nThe waiter grunted, tapping me on the arm with his fist. \"It's not *just* that. I like this place much better when it's quiet, is all. I can do my job with the radio on in the background. But no, now we gotta go and pretend like this is some sorta art caf\u00e9 or Lord knows what. Kit's nice enough, I suppose, but I wish she'd take her business elsewhere.\" \n\nNettie hid a chuckle behind her hand. \"It's good for her, though. She'll finally have a stable income if this works out. No matter how small it may be.\"\n\nI nodded. \"Give her music some time. It grows on you.\"\n\n\"I bet. Like a tumor or something.\" He sighed, shook his head and then trotted over to Kit Sutton to help her with her microphone. He'd put on his customer service smile again, hiding his lack of enthusiasm when he loudly introduced the guests to my roommate and read out the first title of her program. She would only be permitted to play, as she'd put it, \"vanilla songs\"\u2014that's to say, no risqu\u00e9 themes, vulgar language or references to obscure sex acts. That admittedly canceled out a good chunk of her original work, but she was happy enough for the opportunity to ignore that small disappointment. \n\nMy savior human and I looked on with mild interest as she began to sing, starting off with one of my all-time favorites of hers, *The Pretzel Tango.* I tapped my foot along to the rhythm, sipping from my glass of coconut water. It was nice. My best friend was happy, Kit Sutton looked confident and relaxed, and I could tell that the dark look on Frank Preston's attractive face would brighten in time. \n\nAnd then I saw her.\n\nShe was standing by the door, her arms crossed and her head tilted. At first I didn't notice that her long black skirt was completely drenched, until my eyes were drawn to the droplets of water pooling at her feet. Her hair was hidden beneath a woolen hat, but I spotted a single strand of pale blue having fled from its confinement. I let my eyes roam her features. The longer I looked, the more I noticed that simply didn't *add up*. Her skin had an odd sheen to it and her eyes seemed too large for her head. Her mouth and chin region were slightly misshapen, like the teeth she was hiding behind her tightly sealed lips were massive. I stared at her, feeling my frown deepen. All of a sudden, she whipped her head around and met my gaze. Her glare held a terrifying sense of comprehension. There was an open threat in her snarl. \n\nI half expected her to throw herself across the table right there in front of all the other people, to lunge at either me or Kit with fangs bared, but she did no such thing. Spinning around, she slipped out the door and hastened to distance herself from the diner.\n\nI hurriedly whispered a couple words of excuse to my savior human before rising to my feet and racing after her, catching a few odd looks from the other customers as I burst through the door. My pulse thrumming in my ears, I frantically glanced up and down the street. I caught a glimpse of her shirt disappearing behind a corner house and immediately took off running. Dodging the passersby in my path, I struggled to catch up with her. I felt the skin of my back stretch, my tentacles already straining against the back of my t-shirt, struggling to emerge. I tried to suppress the fear constricting my chest. I couldn't let these inhuman parts of my body be seen in public, but it was hard to contain myself. \n\nThis woman had stalked Kit to the diner. She was one of them, I knew it, even though I had no real grasp on what *they* were. She was dangerous, just as much as the spider crab or the humanoid from the concert. \n\nI picked up my pace when I saw her jogging down the street ahead of me. My breaths were coming in low, shallow gasps; goosebumps having formed on my nervously tingling skin. Still, I forced myself to speed up, the soles of my shoes drumming on the asphalt. The houses and storefronts seemed to fly by in a blur as I passed them, eyes locked on my target. I was beginning to close in on her. At the same time, I noticed that she was leading me to the outskirts of town, to the beachside. \n\nThe roaring of the waves greeted me alongside the smell of salt and sea. It wafted towards me and I ran straight into it, like a wall. The wind whipped off the stranger's hat, sending brightly blue hair spilling out from underneath. We raced across the gravelly expanse, kicking up sand and droplets of water as the oncoming tide wet our ankles. \n\n\"Stop!\" I bellowed, the sounds of the shore nearly drowning out my voice. The woman turned her head, albeit only briefly. She continued to head towards the boulders and rubble piling up beneath the cliff. My lungs were burning, the muscles of my legs screaming in pain, but I willed my exhausted body to go further, faster\u2014I had to reach her before she'd take off climbing. I was almost right behind her; the stormy gusts of air blowing her long hair into my arms when I reached out to grasp it. Taking one final leap, I managed to bunch several thick strands of it in my fist, tearing at it with all my might. She spun around, letting go of a sharp cry, and I barely managed to dodge the fist she sent flying towards me. \n\nI had succeeded though. At the very least, I'd gotten her to stand still. She hissed at me, her lips curling back to reveal long, sharp teeth. They bent outward, along with her gums, seemingly her entire jaws\u2014I felt distinctly reminded of an anglerfish. My breath caught in my throat as I swallowed a scream, stumbling back as she advanced on me. We were all alone out here. I hastily pulled off my top, tentacles unfurling from my back. Even though other concerns were clearly at the forefront of my mind, I couldn't help but wonder whether the fangs I had grown the other day looked similarly nightmarish. \n\n\"Listen to me,\" I began, pitching my voice against the wind. \"Stop chasing Kit Sutton. Leave her alone. I will kill every last one of you, every one you send her way.\" I sincerely hoped she couldn't hear the tremor of uncertainty in those words.\n\nShe didn't respond immediately. Instead, she circled me in small, measured steps. Her pupils were blown. Milky, shimmering black filled the spaces between her thin lids. Two black holes staring at me from within a twisted, monstrous visage. Then the babbling started. She spoke that same language my roommate had recited for me, the words somehow sounding like raging water. They sprayed out from behind her teeth at a mad cadence, so fast and so sibilant that I couldn't catch a single one. Hearing her talk was as fascinating as it was chilling. I felt strangely drawn in; I couldn't help but freeze and listen intently. It was completely incomprehensible to me. There was only one thing she kept repeating, one that stood out. *Chandra.* \n\n\"What does that mean?\" I asked sharply, my lips quivering.\n\nShe kept on gibbering, inching ever closer.\n\n\"I. Don't. Understand.\" I took another step back.\n\nAnd then she pounced on me. She toppled me over, momentarily stunning me and taking the chance to rake sharp nails square across my face. I howled as I felt hot blood instantly gushing out and running down my cheeks. Shoving an arm in between us, I managed to throw her off of me, rolling over with her and straddling her. Shifting my weight onto her stomach, I grabbed her wrists with my inhuman limbs, pressing them against the sandy ground. She kicked and squirmed, thrashing around in my grip, but I remained as firm and unyielding as I could. \n\n\"Stop coming!\" I shouted at her, flinching at the threat of her snapping jaws. \"Leave her alone, you understand? Leave her alone!\" \n\nSuddenly, the woman fell still. Her dark eyes glaring at me in defiance, she slackened, the tension leaving her body. And then, all of a sudden, she disappeared. It happened within the blink of an eye. Her once solid form dissolved right there beneath me, liquifying, turning into water. It flowed past my spread legs to merge with the waves lapping at the shore. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. For a moment, all I could do was sit and stare at the retreating tide. When I finally found it within me to draw myself up and rise to my feet, I noticed that the better part of my pants was completely soaked. \n\nIt looked as if I'd peed myself.\n\nWith my face a flayed mess and my clothes drenched, I went about my walk of shame back home.\n\n\n[X](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrypticPark?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13dr5g0/help_im_stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[2: deadbeat roommate](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13eovqy/im_stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_also_i/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[3: creepy crush](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13fnc4u/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_everyone/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[4: relocation](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13gjpwd/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_does_anybody/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[5: beach concert](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13heih5/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_something/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[6: First date](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13ib2es/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_my_first/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[7: Temp work](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13ja7jx/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_temp_work/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[8: roommate talk](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13k8088/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_a_talk_with/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[9: a dismal worldview](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13l69a9/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_the_world/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[10: warehouse](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13m8e9w/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_something/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[11: staircase](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13o0npw/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_we_visited_a/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[13: hurt](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13q2hrx/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_i_should_not/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)",

Despite all of my training I tend to keep to myself and do my best to avoid getting in fights, but that's a line I've heard from other people and seen on TV/in movies a lot.
