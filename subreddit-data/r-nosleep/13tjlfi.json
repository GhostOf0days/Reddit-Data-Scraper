    "postText": " \n\nIt\u2019s been two hours, two. Damn. Hours. Since that things been knocking. It\u2019s been knocking everywhere. My doors, my windows, hell even my ceiling.\n\nAnd I can\u2019t take it anymore, I already lost my best friend Thomas to my stupid actions. I should've listened to Thomas and I wouldn\u2019t be in the situation I\u2019m in.\n\nIf I could go back In time just three hours ago, I would stop myself from doing this stupid game. \n\nMy name is Tyler. Tyler Hodges, and with the little time I have left I\u2019m going to explain how I myself got into this situation. \n\nThomas and I were at my house, as I invited him over since my parents were out of town for a couple of days for a business trip.\n\nI met Thomas back in kindergarten, he was always the calm one between us two. I was always getting us into trouble, I don\u2019t know why Thomas stayed friends with me but I do appreciate him for being there for me as a friend.\n\nAs We sat in my living room, I was browsing through the internet on the home computer as Thomas watched whatever he was watching on tv.\n\nThomas made a comment about the show he was watching about how the show was doing a ritual trying to summon a demon and it peaked my interest.\n\nAs I heard about ritual games before, I only played a handful of them. Bloody Mary was one of the games I played and to my disappointment it didn\u2019t work. \n\nAs I wanted some fun, I typed in the search bar \u201creal creepy ritual games for beginners \u201d as I thought all rituals games were fake. I scrolled for about three to six minutes until Thomas stood over me looking at the computer.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s got you so damn hooked man? It can\u2019t be that interesting you didn\u2019t hear me calling you\u201d he said while leaning over now.\n\n\u201cSince you were talking about ritual games, I wanted to see if there were any ones that actually worked\u201d I said while giving thomas a smile.\n\nIt\u2019s not like I didn\u2019t believe in the supernatural but sometimes I just think that it\u2019s all a lie and just exaggerated. \n\nAs I turned my focus back on the screen, my stomach sank a bit as a pop up ad displayed on the screen. It was a red and black box with big bold blood words.\n\n\u201cFuntime\u201d\n\nIt read back, me and Thomas exchanged weirded out looks with each other. We both looked back at the screen we was confused how it appeared without me clicking any links.\n\n\u201cW-What the actual fuck\u201d Thomas muttered out as he  didn\u2019t break eye contact with screen. His eyes were fixated on the pop up ad, his face said it all he was getting scared.\n\nAnd I started to get a little freaked out too so I don\u2019t blame him, But foolishly I clicked the link. \n\nThe screen went black for a couple seconds, then a red background with a skull appeared on the screen. The skull had a red and black arrow embedded in it. The skull was slowly rotating as it played old music.\n\nAbout 15 seconds later some text appeared on the screen.\n\n\u201cBored and have nothing going on in your pathetic life? How about playing three knocks? It\u2019s a new ritual game and it\u2019s real easy to play, all you need to do is follow these simple steps.\n\n1. Grab three candles and place them in a triangle formation. It doesn\u2019t matter what candle you use as long as they light.\n\n2. Get any sharp tool that can draw blood as you will need to give up some blood in order for the game to start \n\n3. You will need a sheet of paper as you will have to write the phrase \u201cthree knocks\u201d in blood. It doesn\u2019t have to be perfect, it just has to be done.\n\nAs you follow the three steps to the game, if done correctly every light in said room will flicker on and off three times and you will know when the game has started.\n\nand whatever happens do not. I repeat. Do not open any door that you heard three knocks from. Let\u2019s just say you won\u2019t like what would happen if you were to open the door.\u201d\n\nI sat there confused and intrigued as the screen turned black and then flashed multiple different colors before I exited out to the Home Screen. \n\nI turned my head toward Thomas and saw the look on his face. He looked scared and he was shaking a little and his eyes wouldn\u2019t  leave from off the screen.\n\nAs I placed my hand onto his shoulder I waited for him to react but he didn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cAre you alright Thomas? Talk to me man.\u201d I said while shaking him a little bit\n\n\u201cD-do you think the game is actually real or do you think it\u2019s a waste?\u201d Thomas asked as his voices shook.\n\nThomas never liked anything horror related, hell he didn\u2019t even like stupid corny zombie movies. But for me I love everything horror, to the movies, the games, and even the books.\n\nBut I would always get upset that the  ritual games would never work making me waste my time. But what was the difference with this game?\n\nWhat if it\u2019s a fraud and another complete waste of time? But what if the game is actually true and it works?\n\nThomas finally broke away from his trance with the screen and took a couple of steps back while slowly shaking his head.\n\n\u201cNo. No. No. Tyler we\u2019re not playing this damn game. I\u2019m having a real bad feeling about it.\u201d He said while shaking his head and slowly starting to curl into a ball.\n\nI wanted to tell Thomas that he was overreacting and wanted to calm him down. But before I could the computer screen flashed once again with some text on the screen.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong Tyler? Are you scared?\u201d In big bold bloody letters. My stomach turned and twisted in fear and confusion. \n\nHow did it know my name? Is it a virus in my computer? It had to have been a virus from the ad. But my fear also turned into confidence as I wanted to prove that this game was fake.\n\nAs I turned to Thomas, I went up to him and placed my hand on his shoulder\n\n\u201cHey come on Thomas, the game is obviously fake and it\u2019s just here to scare you  man. And I\u2019m right here with you.\u201d I said while giving him a hand up.\n\nHe wiped his eyes as we started to gather the items for the ritual game. But I couldn\u2019t get rid of that bad feeling, and the confidence I had a couple minutes quickly faded away as we sat the stuff down.\n\nI was scared but I couldn\u2019t let Thomas know that I was. I placed the candles in the triangle formation as we were instructed to do. \n\nThomas handed me a knife he got from the kitchen. I took a deep breath before I dragged the knife against the tip of my pointer finger.\n\nI felt the stinging sensation as my blood dripped onto the white sheet of paper. As I grit my teeth, I drew out the word \u201cthree Knocks\u201d onto the paper.\n\nMe and Thomas waited for what felt like an eternity for something to happen. I was about to blow out the candle before I felt my heart drop to my stomach.\n\nEvery light in the living room flickered on and off three times. I stopped and paused as not even five seconds I heard three knocks on my front door.\n\n\u201cBoom.Boom.Boom\u201d they started off light but the second sets of knocks gotten harder and louder. I turned to Thomas and I saw the look on his face, he had tears running down his face and snot coming out  his nose.\n\nThe knocking became more and more intense as I saw the door almost explode under the pressure from the knocks. All I could hear is the crying from Thomas and the loud knocks.\n\n\u201cBOOM. BOOM. BOOM\u201d \n\nBefore I could get myself up, my front door hinges broke off my door flew completely off. I froze as a big bendy creature crouched down to fit in my doorway.\n\nIt\u2019s face was covered in red and black eyes. It\u2019s body was long dark and lengthy, it\u2019s disgusting body was covered in arms and hands. It had two long pincers as its hands.\n\nI tried to move and pick Thomas up but it was already to late. Whatever that hellish thing was stabbed Thomas in his back with one of its pincers as he tried to get up and run.\n\n\u201cHELP ME TYLER, DON\u2019T LEAVE ME PLEASE.\u201d Thomas yelled as he tried to fight back. \n\nI stood there as he called for my help and I just stood there, I felt the tears run down my face. I felt my legs moving as I pick up the knife and started running up the stairs.\n\nI tried to control my breathing but it was hard as it was hard and ragged. I couldn\u2019t hear Thomas\u2019s screams, only things I could hear is my cries, movement behind me, and the knocking.\n\nI felt unbearable pain in my left leg and I fell on the stairs. I was being dragged down the stairs, I gripped the knife and quickly turned around and just planted the knife wherever I could.\n\nI heard shrieks unknown to man but I couldn\u2019t sit there. I picked myself up and climbed up the rest of the stairs. I looked back, and I saw the angry eyes of the creature.\n\nI finally got up the steps and jumped in my room closing the door and locking it. I looked at my leg, a big wound in my thigh and it left a small puddle of blood with it.\n\nMy heart stopped beating as I heard the loud thunderous knocks on my bedroom door. I can\u2019t take it, and it knows I can\u2019t. \n\nIt\u2019s toying with me and I know it is. I saw my laptop, and decided with my final moments I would share this experience with whoever sees this to try and persuade anybody from trying the game.\n\nThe door isn\u2019t going to hold for long. But if anybody is reading this, please do not attempt to play this game as you will suffer its wrath. \n\nAnd as for Thomas, I hope you could forgive me.",
