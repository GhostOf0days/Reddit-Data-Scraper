    "postText": "   My name is Brent Gleeson. Last year was a very eventful year for me.Let me start off and tell you about my roommate. His name is Tony Bakinson. Tony put an ad up looking for a new roommate. I was a broke college student and I was in search of a cheap place to live for the time being. When I moved in Tony set some rules. 1. Don\u2019t go into the owner's closet. 2. No people over after 9:00. 3. Be in my room by 11:00 or don\u2019t come back for the rest of the night. Tony started off as a generally awesome guy, he made home cooked meals, let me play his video games, and got groceries. It was when I forgot/broke the third rule, when Tony\u2019s other side started to show. He snapped at me and told me I either come back at 11:00 or I spend the rest of the night out of the house. It was one random day Tony left for his \u201cwork\u201d that he left the key to his own private closet. \n    \n   I decided a little snooping could never hurt anybody. I was dead wrong. I knew I had to be careful and I knew if he found out I would surely be kicked out\u2026or worse. When I opened the door, I found it wasn\u2019t even a closet, but a separate room? There were no visible lights on except for one light switch I saw in the corner of the room. I flicked it on and I saw a drawer. I opened the drawer to see a pile of fake I.D.s. Who was Bill Thompson or who was Samuel Parker, or Jack Williams? The I.Ds all had a picture of \u201cTony Bakinson\u201d. I looked in another corner of the room and saw a closet. Upon opening I saw a knife, some rope and a piece of paper. On the piece of paper I saw a plan to kill someone. I looked and saw my name with the apartment layout. I then saw blood spattered on the ground near the corner of a wall. I then saw the wall was weak around that area and I was able to remove part of it. What I saw horrified me. I saw the four different bodies of \u201cTony Bakinsons\u201d past roommates, all dead with many different wounds. I then heard the door open to the house. \n    \n   I scrambled into a hiding place under a table. I saw missing posters for all of Tony's roommates under the table. I then saw Tony walk in, I remembered I had never shut and locked the door when I entered, Tony came in with a new fresh body. It was likely Tony did not think I was home. And after a while, he hid the body and left. Right when Tony left I called the cops and told the operators my address and reported a serial killer. Once they got to the house I realized it was safe to leave. I showed the officers everything and they put up warnings for the surrounding areas. The cops asked if I had anywhere to stay. I stayed with my parents who live far away but would let me stay with them for the time being. \n    \n   The police force has still not found Tony, or whatever his real name is, but they say they will notify me if or when they get a lead. I\u2019ve seen someone creeping around my parents neighborhood recently and I\u2019m scared for my life. What still bothers me is that the police still haven\u2019t notified me and I\u2019m getting worried that one day I won\u2019t wake up.",
