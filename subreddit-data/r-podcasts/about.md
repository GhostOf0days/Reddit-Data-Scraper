Description:

r/podcasts: a subreddit to discover, discuss, and review podcasts with other podcast enthusiasts. As part of this mission, r/podcasts is curated to promote respectful and on-topic discussions. This is not a place to promote your podcast.

Rules:

Self-promotion: Self-promotion is not allowed unless your podcast directly relates to a newly posted thread AND you clearly disclose your involvement with it. Self-promotion can be no more than 10% of your total recent involvement with r/podcasts. Self-promotion posts are NEVER allowed. Failure to comply will result in your posts being removed and/or you being banned.

Podcasting: This subreddit is geared towards podcast listeners. Posts made by podcast creators about podcast hosting, editing gear, starting a podcast, etc. are not allowed and will be removed.

Service solicitation: Service solicitation posts (e.g. "I'm looking for an editor for my podcast" or "I'm an editor looking for work") are not allowed and will be removed.

FAQs and recommendations: Some questions are asked very regularly and have already been answered before. Similarly, many recommendation requests are seen commonly. If your post is a FAQ or common recommendation request, a moderator may remove your post. 

Check the FAQ section of the wiki for more helpful info. If your question is still unanswered, then you can ask your question in the stickied weekly thread.

Feedback/content requests: Feedback requests and idea searches are not allowed in this subreddit. This is not a place to think of an idea for your podcast, a niche to cover, a podcast name, or how to present your show. Please use the search function to find what you are looking for, or check out other subreddits.

Bashing posts: Bashing posts are not allowed. Posts centered solely on bashing a podcast, genre, ads, mouth noises, live shows, digital media company, podcasters, something that annoys you about podcasts, etc. are not allowed. These do not contribute positively to conversation and will be removed.

Civil critiques are permissible in the weekly r/podcasts General Discussion threads, and users are welcome to express complaints in that thread. Please note that rants and rudeness will be removed.

Other post requirements: Posts must be made in English and related to podcasts. 
Spam posts with unhelpful, unrelated, or non-meaningful content will be removed.
Posts containing links only and other low effort posts will be removed.
Use a descriptive title when posting. If your title is too vague, your post may be removed. 
It is not permitted to post or ask for copyright-protected materials that are behind a paywall or pulled from feeds.

Low karma: New Redditors with low karma scores may find their posts and comments removed by the automod. You must have both a post and comment karma score above our minimum to participate in r/podcasts. **Do not** reach out to us via modmail to ask our karma minimums, as we will not disclose them.

Reddit's content policy: Express yourself freely, explore strange new worlds, and boldly go where you've never gone before. But remember the Prime Directive of Netiquette: Those are real people out there. This means follow [site-wide rules](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy) and [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/205926439) and be civil to one another.

Contacting the Mods: Want to contact the mods about something? Do so by sending us modmail. If you reply in response to a removal comment, chat a mod, or PM a mod directly, you will not be answered.
