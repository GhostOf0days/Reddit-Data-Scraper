    "postText": "Been seeing discussion both on here and in r/ApplyingToCollege about how interviews don\u2019t matter, more for you to ask questions, etc. and how they don\u2019t have much bearing on your admissions chances. I\u2019ve also seen questions about whether getting an interview means you\u2019re likely to get admitted. Let me break this down.\n\n1. Interviews are a random selection of a random selection. What that means is that only a certain selection of candidates are randomly selected to be in the interview portal to even be considered for an interview. Of that selection, you are basically randomly chosen by interviewers like me. Now, I put some degree of thought behind who I choose\u2014 mainly because I went to b school and can\u2019t speak much to someone wanting to major in Linguistics\u2014 but it\u2019s pretty random. So an interview invite by itself is NO INDICATION that you\u2019ll get into Emory.\n\n2. Interviews absolutely matter\u2026to a degree. As an interviewer and based on the information I\u2019ve received from Emory, the way I understand it is:\n\n- An alright interview won\u2019t help you but won\u2019t hurt you. But at least you can ask questions about Emory.\n\n- A fantastic interview review can and many times will put you over the edge if it\u2019s close. \n\n- A terrible interview can dash your chances at Emory, even if your chances were hopeful before. \n\n3. So what is a terrible/good interview? Well, let\u2019s illustrate with examples from kids I\u2019ve interviewed so far. \n\nCandidate A showed up before the interview time fully prepared. She was bubbly and enthusiastic and friendly, and a very good conversationalist. She had clear academic and career goals and why Emory was a perfect place to explore them. She highlighted the benefits of a liberal arts education even in the context of business. She asked insightful questions about my experience that she\u2019d clearly put thought into. And she sent a nice thank you email afterwards. \n\nCandidate B showed up a few minutes after the interview. She was boring and unfriendly, almost sounding like she didn\u2019t want to be there. No concrete reasons why Emory was a good place apart from \u201cit\u2019s in Atlanta\u201d (not really lol) and the business school is good. She rambled a ton. Didn\u2019t really have any thought out answers or interesting passions to share. Her questions were very generic. And she made one or two xenophobic comments. I wasted no time in recommending a denial of admission in detail. \n\n4. How to prepare for interviews?\n\nWell there are tons of articles first of all on typical college interview questions. Secondly, really read the essays you wrote and reflect on why Emory is a fit and what your personal story is. Lastly, come prepared with questions that aren\u2019t answered online.\n\nWith all this being said, I\u2019m an interviewer this season and if anyone is interested, they can PM me and I\u2019m happy to see if they are in the interview portal/give an interview!",

You clearly made the point of basically saying that, in the context you are talking about (a meh interview with a somewhat uninterested applicant who likely did little beyond superficial research about Emory) constitutes a fairly empty response that doesn't go much beyond what Emory told interested parties in brochures/admissions related communications and \"propaganda\".  I'm sorry that you got dragged into some silly conversation about that when it was clearly not the point you were making (maybe they think an interview is an AP test or something where the believe the interviewed applicant should get some credit for recognizing that Emory is in Atlanta and allegedly viewing it as a positive aspect. \"It wasn't really meaningful and had no elaboration, but just give them credit because college admissions is hard!\").  I could care less where the applicant thinks Emory is versus the financial districts when they mention it (and people have Google before an interview or even putting in an application to figure that sort of thing out if they really really care), but I'd rather them not just have a response that \"I like Emory because it is in major metropolitan area or city\" and then basically nothing else (perhaps because they barely cared to learn about Emory or at Atlanta).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have my things I harp on as well but damn!  Your post was supposed to be informative in terms of how the selection process works (or doesn't) and what a person like you may characterize as a good, solid, versus meh interview and your examples made sense and were contextualized properly IMO.  I guess people are in troll mode though (let us pull out this one irrelevant thing and make you respond to it).",

Do you think, based off of these few details, it was probably one of the good interviews?",

Were you asked about your personality/motivations/passions and did you speak about things in great detail vs. a 1 word response? If you did the former then great job.\n\nIn terms of post interview questions my best practice is to always ask questions specific to the interviewer vs. about Emory. This makes the conversation personalized, and most people like to talk about themselves! Ex. \u201cWhat were your favorite classes in the business school\u201d? vs. \u201cWhat classes are offered in the business school?\u201d. You get the point.",

To your question, yes, I\u2019m seeing if you\u2019re someone I want to be around at Emory/someone I find both cool and smart.\n\n2. Have an actual reason for going to college/going to Emory. Helps if you have a career goal in mind too, and how Emory can help achieve it.\n\n3. Have some actual intellectual interests (aka something besides Netflix or sleeping).\n\nBased on candidate responses we write a review (including what was said/our thoughts on it) across these three dimensions. I\u2019d say the process is pretty similar across other schools and their interviews.",
