    "postText": "Dear Emory community,\n \nI hope this message finds you safe and well. We are writing to provide updates for you on two important matters. \n \nWe know that everyone\u2019s first question is the status of the fall semester. Answering that question is the focus of our daily work, as we plan for what we hope will be in-person instruction, albeit with many important adaptations and protections in place to prevent the spread of COVID-19 within our community. This work is guided by the principles for decision making that we discussed during last month\u2019s town hall. While we would like to share with you a definitive decision about our status for the fall, we are simply not yet prepared to do so and likely cannot for some weeks. However, we commit to providing an update on our progress by June 15. \n \nAs was shared during last month\u2019s town hall, we continue to assess the financial impact COVID-19 will have on the university. While we anticipate an approximately $10 million shortfall for our current fiscal year due to lost revenue related to the suspension of mission-related activities, costs related to supporting students\u2019 financial needs, faculty and staff salary continuation, and new incurred COVID-19 related costs, we do not know the full scope of loss for the upcoming fiscal year. As we approach the traditional beginning of the fall semester, we expect a clearer financial picture, but we should not wait any longer to implement additional financial measures that will help mitigate additional losses. \n \nIn keeping with our decision-making principles, noted above, we are writing today to share the first of what will be several actions in the coming months. Effective July 1, President Sterk, the President\u2019s Leadership Team and the deans will reduce their compensation by 15 percent. This reduction, which will be subject to review at the end of calendar year 2020, is not just a cost-savings step, but also a representation of the commitment the leadership team has to preserving Emory\u2019s academic and research missions in the face of financial challenges. \n \nThank you for your continued resilience during these uncertain times and for your patience as we thoughtfully and systematically work through many decisions for our Emory community to continue to move forward this Fall. \n \n \nSincerely,\n \nClaire E. Sterk, President\n \nJan Love, Interim Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs\n \nChristopher L. Augostini, Executive Vice President for Business and Administration, Chief Financial Officer\n \nJonathan S. Lewin, Executive Vice President for Health Affairs, Executive Director, Woodruff Health Sciences Center, President, CEO, and Chairman of the Board, Emory Healthcare",

                            "comment": "Yeah, I think Emory is a lot more lean since the Wagner era departmental cuts (which I still don't agree with, especially.  And any relatively new programs have been pretty resilient and would be protected.  Like QTM, Human Health, and the rearranged ILA majors are doing pretty well enrollment or impact wise.  And it would be pretty damaging to reverse progress they have had in sort of bringing back in film and visual arts (that would look REALLY bad considering that they recently dropped this strategic planning booklet about the arts).  Now that I think about it, it appears, going into Covid, Emory may have been doing better than I thought.\n\nThere were some schools (hint: ranked above us but not in top 10) that proposed and were planning to copy Emory's QTM on some scale as early as a year or 2 ago and they never followed through indicating that everything is not as rosy as they market to outsiders (Emory's QTM department is practically roaring and they can't even get theirs off the ground. Oops!).  Emory better find some way to ride this rough wave and be happy it has the advantage of having made some of the major programmatic changes it wanted and needed to between the last recession and this one, so at least it doesn't have to worry about some key initiatives falling apart before they even got off the ground like they did with the 09' recession (that was just brutal.  I swear biology and chemistry's elective course offerings basically dried up because of the hiring freezes and not having the money to offer what they wanted to).",

I believe Emory was inspired by Northwestern, but currently Emory's undergraduate program seems extremely robust and interdisciplinary.  Like faculty in many departments have developed electives to contribute to it.  I imagine if they can work out some kinks and get even more co-curricular stuff going, they are on their way to being on par with other interdisciplinary programs like NBB.  It is also impressive how many humanities and social sciences majors are flocking to it (vs. Emory recruiting a different breed of life sciences STEM major for example). \n\n I feel like for some reason, this can really only happen at Emory due to the contingent of students who don't wanna do business or econ. majors but want to keep themselves open to careers outside of like consulting, law, and the IB craze you see at some other elites. I think this is really good because Emory is not well-represented in some fields and maybe this program can help diversify career pathways that students pursue (and establish an alumni base in them).",

Coming to Fenves, I really hope he expands the Engineering Sciences program in the Physics department. It has the potential to blossom into a full-fledged interdisciplinary program which can propel students directly into an engineering MS/PhD with a (perhaps) stronger theoretical background than the average student with an engineering BS. From there, Emory can work with the soft/condensed matter research group (and Tech) to develop a proper material sciences program.",

Emory has a lower endowment than super elite privates and recruits poorer students and more Pell Grant recipients than all of them (go to the 2011 NYT study on wealth at these schools. Emory is far at the bottom in terms of median family income of its peers and that was BEFORE they started heavily recruiting QB and/or Pell Grant recipients as it is today).  \n\nThis is very costly because need aid must cover the rest of their tuition.  So this is lots of money coming from ECAS which isn't that wealthy. For 5-10 years, Emory could not compete at all for the super high stats \"grey area\" (ones near 100k or a little over- and then that isn't far below Emory's median family income of students so that means the median student at Emory is accumulating more debt than average) students vs. places that effectively used admissions to buy that group with their aid packages.  So some schools got to pump up their stats and put on a show for quite a while when USNWR weighted such \"selectivity\" metrics more.  They milked that and students at some of these places went around claiming stupid stuff like \"look, we're just like HYP students. Look at our scores\". Emory missed the manufactured selectivity boat (it has made up ground there because the Scholarship endowment is kicking in, but too late if you want to use scores and stuff to massage rankings. Again, that has been de-emphasized AND the scores and stuff have kind of converged across top schools. The differences are pretty meaningless)\n\nAnd then there are downstream effects. You have to have very strong support programs to support truly lower income students at a place like Emory.  Emory is pretty rigorous in the sense that there aren't many party pathway majors and stuff like that. Most everyone is competing or doing majors that are fairly serious (in terms of requirements and whatnot) and the low income students (I was one) are no different (an awful lot of us pursue STEM).  Emory has very strong support programs vs. a lot of other places that support students of all walks of life through such paths, but it still incurs risk to the retention rate and graduation rate and you can clearly see that both of those lags behind peers that rank closer(and ranked closer before) to us, so gotta work on that (I think Emory Undergraduate Project is helping now but we won't see those effects for a while).  But those metrics weigh very heavily in the rank.\n\nAnother one that was kind of unavoidable (and has nothing to do with admissions really) was the enrollment increases they did post recession to kind of soften the blow on ECAS. Appears as if they are trying to reverse this, but it caused the student:faculty ratio to go from 7:1 to 9:1 and that was/is important to the rank.  I personally think it isn't a big deal as much of Emory's undergrad academics actually improved and reformed during this period, but USNWR has no way to see that sort of stuff and prospective students have limited insight or care for that sort of thing.  The initial foray for the more shallow among them is to say:\"well USNWR says it is somewhat below X so it must be lesser academically\" with no real evidence this is the case.\n\n I think Emory draws less shallow students than some places but there are still plenty with a chip on the shoulder or an unwarranted low opinion of it vs. some near peers because they don't know much about other ways to compare it to them. If they did, they would see that Emory has been punching above its weight (in terms of selectivity and the connectivity and relative wealth of students vs. near peers) for a while and is on par with them.  I think students should take pride in the fact that Emory does some key things very different for undergrads but unfortunately that requires that students actually KNOW that it does.  Not having sports and more of a party atmosphere has not prevented WUSTL, Chicago, and JHU students from having pride in what they have but Emory seems to never get rid of that problem (maybe because many of its recruits envisioned themselves at more of a party school.  I think there are ways Emory could change that, but it also takes work).",
