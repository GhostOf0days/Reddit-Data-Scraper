    "postText": "I'm a current freshman this year and I can honestly say I hate college. \n\nIt's not like the classes are overwhelmingly stressful or too hard and I'm not well adjusted enough to deal with failure- except for some annoying professors, my schoolwork is fine. It's just everything else. \n\n1) The food is bad. I love food, so this is a major strike for me.\n\n2) Housing sucks. I didn't expect it to be a blast, but people are so disrespectful by being loud at like 2 am, like it is unreal, like screaming and laughing and running down the hall. The bathroom is a nightmare because people on my hall leave their hair and trash everywhere, plus the water takes forever to heat up and once it does it either scalding or cold.\n\n3) I have to fight to try and get involved in the community but everything is applications and interviews, which I understand for some positions is necessary, but its exhausting. But you aren't active in a club if you aren't on the exec board. And I consider myself competitive, but damn not everything needs to be a competition.\n\n4) Because of my lack of in-person classes and community involvement, I've made a singular friend the past year on campus that I see maybe once a week. And I'm someone who is pretty friendly, I had tons of friends in high school, I just am not good at reaching out to strangers to hangout, there's not platform for me to meet people where the interaction is organic.\n\nI just find myself just really not liking people. I mean, the plethora of people on campus that have just decided that wearing a mask in mandatory and the music that vibrates my walls while I am trying to study because people decide it's not good enough that they can hear their music, everyone else should.\n\nLike I have always been really excited for college and I was involved in so many clubs in high school, if something was happening, I probably had some part in it. And that was in a highly competitive high school, one of the best in my state, so it's not like I'm a stranger to the high-achiever environment. \n\nAnd everyone else seems to be fine, they have friends to go to the farmers market with and they get to be involved in res life or research, and I feel like I'm just existing without really existing.\n\nI'm just feeling so emotionally burnt out. I mean, the amount of debt I'm taking out for THIS? A couple crappy zoom sessions a week? I only have had one in person class, and next semester I will only have one again because apparently science classes don't get in person classes. \n\nOther than bare minimum instruction, Emory is offering me nothing. And I feel like this frustration is bubbling up because so many people ask me about my experience and prospective students asking for advice, and I just say everything is great because I really want to believe that its true. I don't want to tell my family I'm not happy, I'm like the one functional child they have rn. And idk what to do now, idk if college just isnt for me and I should drop, or EMORY just isnt for me, or the pandemic just ruined everything. I just figured I would go to college, and even if it wasn't super interesting, it's just school. I didnt realize how miserable just existing here would make me.\n\nand yes, i made a throwaway specifically to post this because I have nobody to talk to, i just want to know if theres someone, anyone out there that feels like this past year has been as useless as I felt it has been.",

I haven't been on campus so idk what food and housing is like... but it has been a rough semester when there's a 13-14 time difference and being a freshman with no friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEven if I make acquaintances it's not the same you know? So, don't worry about feeling burnt out and alone. Just remember that there's a lot of students who also feel the same thing and that it will get better. I wouldn't recommend having huge expectations for the whole \"college experience\" in general, bc then the disappointment would be small too.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd I agree so much on the \"everything\" needing to be a competition. I have been writing applications and doing interviews (I woke up multiple times bc my interview was at like 5am lol). I am pretty competitive too, but it has been so exhausting that every club or position is making you write long-ass applications and even if you got in you have to do an interview.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI guess I am also just writing this in hopes of relating with some of your pain and just venting out. Let's hope it gets better for all of us :) And the semester will end in 2 weeks, so stay strong until then!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(my grammar is so off here but idc bc I was just venting btw lol)",

As for dorm/food stuff, the way I\u2019ve rationalized it is that the college lifestyle isn\u2019t for everyone. Most of my time at Emory had been completely in-person, but I hated living in the dorms, I felt awful cause I was living off of hotdogs and dry chicken, and navigating clubs felt exhausting on top of school and a part-time job. All the same reasons you talked about! I loved my coursework, just not the life that came with it. While some students grow to like it by their sophomore or junior year, and/or make close friends, there are others like me who just never do. And that\u2019s okay! While things might become easier/better for you next fall when it opens back up (I hope so!), I\u2019d recommend keeping in mind that this is just a brief period in your life, and try to find little things to keep you going.\n\nI\u2019m graduating early tho, I can\u2019t take this shit anymore lmaooooo good luck",

            "comment": "Heya, freshman on campus here. \n\nIn terms of food, yeah it's not that good. At least it's better than last semester, but imo with the new changes this semester, I feel like the variety has gone down. It feels like every day I\u2019m eating the same type of food. The only thing I can\u2019t complain about is the salad bar. With the situation with most clubs being application, I hate those. Tried applying to one that seemed cool, didn\u2019t get in. And with housing, it was ok, but the worst part about it was having a suitemate that I don\u2019t talk to.\n\nThis semester has been rough on me too. The first semester was ok with me meeting some people before school started, but right now, I only have 2 friends who I've only seen like 4 times this semester. Covid has made it hard for many of us to meet others, and it really sucks. I consider myself an independent person, but my god, it hurts seeing people out there hanging out with their friends all the time like it\u2019s a normal thing while I consider it an event whenever I hang out with mine. I felt the burnout much more this semester than last, and now that the semester is almost over, I wish it\u2019ll get better next semester in terms of covid and actual events. \n\nThere are a ton of people that are experiencing the same thing as you, myself included, and talking about it is always a good step to take in terms of approaching the problem. I guess me writing this message is essentially what you're doing as well, so hopefully we both can overcome this burnout soon.\n\nSomething I\u2019d recommend doing to meet some people would be joining the dooley\u2019s tavern discord server. There are people from every grade that talk there, and as someone who occasionally lurks in it, I\u2019d say it\u2019s a good spot to get to know people.",

I came from a boarding school and just could not tolerate people vacillating heavily between acting like they were at summer camp, and melting down as if they'd been shipped to Guantanamo away from their family forever.  \n\n\nThe food... yeah, that gets no better on campus. Everyone jokes about the freshman 15 but I never understood it, I lost twenty pounds just eating cereal for every meal because I didn't think anything in the duc was tolerable. If you can afford to get yourself off of campus once or twice a week to get a real meal, I advise it.  \n\n\nThe club thing was actually my godsend, I really struggled to make friends that were in my major but getting involved in theater at Emory is where I made all of my long term connections. I feel like if you can get involved in even the volunteer stuff, or give a whack at something that might be really out of your comfort zone, you'd eventually find your way.  \n\n\nBut yeah, that feeling of just wanting to transfer out haunted me until probably the end of my second semester... All I could advise is just... hang on? I'm hoping in person classes return for y'all because that is a central part of the experience.",

Ask someone that you find cool and friendly! If that person doesn't want to hang out, for sure ask someone else!

It really opened my eyes to what was really important.

Even if it did (unlikely for most even high achievers), I would not have had the same expectations in this type of environment with these conditions.  These all sound like college growing pains (things like people blasting music and whatnot, basically folks not building their lives and preferences around you while living in a communal space vs. you being able to go home after school to predictable conditions assuming a public or charter).  Either way, I hope it improves, but I have been seeing these stories across several sub-reddits this year as I would have anticipated (and I do agree that what these \"elite\" privates are charging for these past 2 Covid semesters isn't worth it at all. I can tell you for a fact that most of the academics aren't even close to the par a normal semester especially in the STEM areas.  Perhaps those in social sciences and humanities have had more luck because those profs. tend to be more creative).\n\nI suspect that increased density and in-person functions and classes will help most students.  Hopefully this applies to you, but either way, give yourself some grace and time to develop.  Instantaneous success and a brochure like experience is even less likely than it would be in a \"normal\" semester.  Either way, welcome to college!  For most it is NOT an instant wonderland, not even at these top tier schools. And sadly, at these types of places, everything(or a lot of things) is a competition. You have people who are really good in the context of several states or even other countries and the student body size is significantly larger than most high schools. Keep aiming for the clubs you wanna join, but please do feel free to get creative or think outside the box and maybe start your own club or personal project based upon an interest you have or need you have identified for Emory, Atlanta, whatever.  That can be very rewarding and have a big impact (you can connect with faculty, staff, invite other students in for help).  Just try to stay encouraged and inspired and don't feel pressure to be part of pre-existing club or in-crowd.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*Also, the opinions on the food seem all over the damned place (I expect lower quality during Covid so maybe the people who say it is pretty good experienced it pre-Covid) just based on other convs on this sub-reddit.  If I had to guess, it is probably quite a bit better than most college food but those who are picky or have more specific dietary needs/restrictions (because of whatever reasons including religious affiliation) still have trouble which is nothing new.  Emory won't be able to ever win everyone when it comes to that it seems.",

And this aspect is really hard to see as a freshman who may not have had particularly interesting courses or professors to inspire you and also had a lower density campus with less going on, but I think things will unveil themselves to you in the upcoming year so keep an open mind.  If you haven't made much faculty connections or gotten mentors, hit the ground running as a sophomore and you'll thank yourself (you'll have to be deliberate how you choose courses and professors to establish this because, to be blunt, some faculty don't want much of a relationship with students beyond the super duper standouts sadly).

For example, you allude to a couple of \"annoying\" professors in the original post.  I have no idea what made them annoying, but if you get another one(s) next year, you never really know.  It is easy to just view these classes as something you need to just perform in and get an A or whatever, so any professor who puts forth seemingly unneccessary (and let us be honest, who are/were we to judge as early career college students.  I remember at one point viewing anything that made me sweat intellectually as perhaps unneccessary then realizing the value much later) obstacles to make you fight for that grade is viewed as annoying, but you may end up getting more out of those professors than you think in terms of learning and a relationship.\n\nLike sometimes even if you aren't the A/A- student but express real interest in the material or really involve them in helping you make progress to one of the more demanding assignments, they'll appreciate all of that effort and it'll be a great way to connect.  Basically they may be \"annoying\" or demanding to intentionally push students towards asking for help or coming to see them in office hours.\n\nMeanwhile some of the instructors who seem easy or even less annoying (or demanding) may be that way because they actually DON'T want to deal with you.  They water stuff down or give a light workload because they know it keeps y'all happy and they ultimately wanna keep you out of their office and don't want students developing higher levels of interest in material or what they are doing and can be awkward or stand-offish because they really just want to use the extra time not engaging with students to write their book or run their labs.  You have to be able to feel out who is who (you'll have a few demanding professors who don't really wanna deal with or have time with you either, but Emory tends to be a place where the more demanding faculty more than not wanna connect with students and are often better teachers also).",

I\u2019ll break down why but it is also important to note that complaining won\u2019t help improve your experience, action will.\n\n1. Idk what food is like on campus but I\u2019m assuming the options are reduced from what is usually served. Emory, given its location in the south and relatively small student population (less people + more dietary options are really expensive for colleges) actually has really good food for a college during normal times. Obviously, it\u2019s not great but that\u2019s the case at every college everywhere. \n2. Also this is typical of literally every freshman dorm in America. Yes, it\u2019s annoying. Ultimately if you want it to go down you need to bring it up with your hall. In my experience the sophomore dorms are much much quieter but I\u2019d bet that next year will also be pretty loud since this year sucked. \n3. It\u2019s true that there are a lot of clubs that you need to apply to but there\u2019s also tons that don\u2019t. The club fair this year was a shitshow but generally a lot of clubs that are featured when things are normal are interest based and don\u2019t require an application to join. Those that do generally have better \u201creach\u201d or marketing I guess to freshman but there are also tons of clubs that don\u2019t ask you to write an essay to get in. If you do some google searches and check Instagram you should be able to find them depending on what hobbies you\u2019re into. This was definitely a pandemic issue cause most non- interview clubs were having issues finding new members. I\u2019d go to the club fair next year and see for yourself. \n4. Making friends during normal times is relatively easy but again you have to put yourself out there. College is all about getting out of your comfort zone, especially socially during the pandemic. Hopefully things will get better. \n\nAlso, masks are absolutely mandatory to wear on campus at all times really not sure where you got the impression that it\u2019s \u201celective\u201d. Literally every email from administration points this out plus countless signs on campus, I\u2019m sure announcements  from RAs, and also the creation of specific jobs for students to monitor if masks are being worn. Masks are currently being planned to be mandatory for next semester too. \n\nEmory is planning on moving a massive amount of online classes to in person for next semester now (as per the email sent out earlier this week) so hopefully you\u2019ll get more classes in person next semester if you decide to stay. It sounds like you may want to consider whether a residential college experience is for you at this time because the issues that you are being up are either present in every college in America or due to the pandemic. It might be a good idea to take some time off and think about whether college is a good fit and if the timing is right (as well, of course, if Emory was the right fit).",

I definitely feel like small things like loud people or subpar food (which I heard was a lot better pre-covid and improved variety wise this semester from last) seemed to bother me more because so much wasn't working out. And I also agree with Covid making clubs harder to be active, I anticipated that. I do plan on diving back in to getting involved next semester along with the new freshman.\n\nAnd per the \"mandatory masks\", sure if you are eating in the student center during certain times people will come around and ask you to put it on, but walking to class there will just be groups of people walking with their masks pulled down to their chins or off. And, like I said, I would be frustrated but it probably wouldn't have bothered me as much if I was in a better state of mind. And hopefully after a break in the summer, I'll have time to refresh.",

            "comment": "I am also a freshman and i felt the same way i was so lost and alone haha i spent so much of my time stuck in my dorm!! i spent like 3 weeks googling transfer schools. Ultimately i decided to stay because its a great school and our freshman year wasnt normal, i believe it would get better for me and its slowly starting to! it will get better for u too ! ll be ur friend !!\n\nfr but something that helped me aside from getting on antidepressants (i was REALLY struggling LMAO)  is just commenting on peoples instagram posts and slowly building relationships, texting in the groupme gc like hey anyone wanna get lunch?? stuff like that! go to ur hall events n stuff. i put myself on the rooming directory to find a roomie and so many ppl contacted me! ur not a lone, theres so many other students that feel lost, freshman yr isnt easy and with covid on top its like mission impossible.\n\nNext semester will be a lot better since more people r coming and there will be less covid restrictions and more events! try to get more in person classes and form study groups. as for food ehhh theres not much more to than than like trying to get off the dining plan n making ur own food. the dorms it rlly just depends on what u got, mine was pretty deserted haha but even there theres solutions just report ppl to the ra dude who cares or blast ur own music. all these little things start to build up and it can make u feel hopeless but like THERES SO MANY PEOPLE at emory!! and theres so much to do, u just have to get out there. join the emory discord too or smth idk!! \n\ndw abt it !! if next semester its still shit then maybe consider transferring but for now give it a chance :) &lt;3",

Either way, if he wants friends he has to go and earn them, whether it's at Emory or elsewhere. Join clubs, learn to cook and cook for others. His hall mates that play their music loud actually great places to start. See if he can leverage a \"new\" interest in music.",
