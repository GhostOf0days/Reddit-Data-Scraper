I do wish the university made more efforts in this regard.",

Georgetown, Penn, and Vandy just aren\u2019t as physically welcoming and their architecture is more ordinary and uninteresting.\n- Quality of and access to professors. Some of them are at the top echelon of their fields... and you can take their classes as a freshman!\n- Variety of other students: yes, Emory has the standard pre-med and Goizueta tropes, but I think a lot of people have other academic interests aside from their pre-professional tracks that some other peer schools lack. Quite a few classics majors go to med school, plenty of music majors are in Goizueta, and even some STEM majors go to law school. Then you have the people who specifically came to Emory for the strength of some of the niche programs, like creative writing and Jewish Studies. It was a little daunting to be in a small (8-person or so) class for two years with someone who was a runner-up for the Rhodes Scholarship, LOL.\n- Practically every department fosters strong writing skills, even the biology department at Oxford (141 and 142 were W classes at least around 2017).  \n- *Most* of the housing is nice and new, excluding JRC and Haygood at Oxford, Dobbs, Alabama, and Complex at main, and the tower at Clairmont.\n- Atlanta was such a cool city to explore as a student. I\u2019d much rather take it over a place like Gainesville or Auburn.",

Also pretty great resources and in my experience, every staff member I\u2019ve spoken to has actually cared and tried (and if they dont, I could easily find someone in that department who does care). My academic writing has improved greatly since I\u2019ve been here. The opportunities that you have here are endless, literally all you have to do is ask. Anything I\u2019ve put in the speak up form has been implemented. Atl campus is probably one of the prettiest. We get sinks in our dorms (none of my friends at other colleges have that). Atlanta is fucking awesome and one of my favorite cities. \n\nThere are downsides to everything and emory definitely has some, but in my experience the positives far outweigh the negatives.",

I wanna ask them what they majored in, what courses they took (and I'll ask to see the materials too especially in something like STEM), and exactly what they learned that is in alignment with the degree deserving more prestige/value than it would have had they pursued the same stuff elsewhere at a \"lesser\" school.  Sadly, there are plenty who are literally trying to flex a piece of paper at the end of their \"elite\" college experience who could have done just as much or even more at a much less prestigious type of school.  They come to these schools, avoid the challenges and opps that develop them most(that these places allegedly have a monopoly on the way people talk about them), and flex their degrees like they did something special.  They'll go \"well we or my friends are doing great things!\" and I just think: \"Y'all were already rich.

I feel bad for that poor poster in that little pre-med thread who let the people at Georgia Tech and Vanderbilt convince her that they had an unusual amount of \"grade deflation\" in pre-med STEM classes, and then let her drive her to go to Emory.  Of course the real problem I have is that such a thing factored so heavily into their decision, but students just say anything with little evidence.  Like I can somewhat see Georgia Tech because they used to have that legacy of TRUE deflation, but when I see other places like VU, Cornell, and Berkeley scream about it, they are being real stuck up and comparing their courses to those at places like Yale, Princeton, Harvard, and Stanford, and they have no idea what those look like (hint:  They are on a completely different level for the most part.  It just isn't comparable and no one wants to have that honest conversation because they'd have to admit that even though they look similar to those places in terms of incoming statistics, the academics have hardly kept up to match those places mainly because those places have almost unlimited resources).

They may be an incoming or prospective student who currently IS seeing a lot of negative and weird posts and naturally wants to see if anyone here has anything good to say and if so, what is good.  Talking to you via DM is not gonna get them that.  I get you're in your feelings but try getting out of them in this case.\n\nThey(and anyone who likes the school, even if a current student) have a good reason to ask for this. You were not the only one criticizing it.  There were posts in other threads about Oxford and generally we were more nuanced than what you'd see on other \"elite\" subreddits where almost everyone lines up like a voltron and says \"you should come here even if it is a lot more than the other option because of prestige (or some other reason that is non-evidence based or makes little sense)\".  There is a lot of stuff going on as people are confused trying to make their college decisions (I don't think they have much more time to choose either).  Basically this ain't all about you.  I can see how the OP saw a pattern and admittedly I contributed to it (and I would continue to.  I actually love Emory but I get what it is good at and have ideas on how and what types of people should approach it.  If I think it is irresponsible to pay loads of money to attend it vs. elsewhere, I will say so.  If I think it is weak for a certain program vs. another option, I will say so). It is what it is.",

I am not down for Emory students and alum being ridiculous like I see at some peer institutions, but it would be nice if there were more posters that felt strongly in the other direction and stuck to a nuanced analysis.\n\nFurther improving the reputation of the school and getting Emory to yield even more of the people who would really enjoy or benefit from it will require REAL work on you and your fellow cohort members part.  You SHOULD criticize it about things that matter in terms of advancing its reputation, but you can't limit criticisms to posts on reddit or CC or wherever.  You have to go to the administration with suggestions and with Fenves being new and aiming to further increase retention rate: [https://president.emory.edu/communications/index.html](https://president.emory.edu/communications/index.html)\n\nAnd a new provost coming in: [https://news.emory.edu/features/2021/04/our-type-of-provost/index.html](https://news.emory.edu/features/2021/04/our-type-of-provost/index.html)\n\nPamela Scully is also your friend and takes this stuff seriously: [https://provost.emory.edu/undergraduate-affairs/who-we-are/pamela-scully.html](https://provost.emory.edu/undergraduate-affairs/who-we-are/pamela-scully.html)\n\nNow(especially with a capital campaign rolling out) is a ripe time for undergraduates to make observations and make real demands that can help Emory become better (and not just better ranked or perceived). Pay attention to this stuff and take advantage of it.  I really think it(aside from endowment level) is one of the major things that differentiates Emory and its nearer peers from those super elite undergraduate student bodies.  The latter is really in the know and concerned about what is going on and knows what demands to make, how to criticize, and who to go to/what to be involved in to rectify those concerns.\n\nLike if you go to the Stanford Daily and Harvard Crimson (and other student pubs at that tier of elite), these students aren't playing around (vicious.  People think the Wheel staff can be vicious with their exposes of whatever, but those other student pubs are very serious) and will criticize every aspect of the university and pay attention to when there are changes in the academics, campus life, everything, and heavily involve themselves in the decision making processes.  Places like Emory tend to have more apathetic students or those who are sort of just \"comfy\" so they don't notice or complain about something until after it is implemented and is affecting them.  I think stuff like that needs to change for the undergrad element of Emory to advance or at least differentiate itself in a positive way from its near peers.  But I could (and have) go on and on, and it would be best to maybe PM via chat if you ever had any ideas or wanted to know some.  I actually think the uni is quite responsive, but it can't respond to things that aren't demanded.",

I wish we knew more about the vision of the new administration beyond being more \"interdisciplinary\" and increasing retention rates. Are there specific departments they'll focus on strengthening? Connections they're focused on building? \n\nThe vision they did talk about is the focus on social justice which frankly irks me. Like WTF are identity spaces??? (I say this as an asian person which apparently is getting its own space). Isn't this what culture clubs are for? As an aside, being a NYC native, I was actually looking forward to being more forced to integrate more and interact with people of different ethnicities. There were enough asians in HS where it was easy for me to hang around an only asian friend group. I was hoping to have this challenged in college. \n\nI'll be keen and plentiful on the criticisms. I'm not sure how much time I'll have once at Emory, but I would like to spend at least some time writing for the Emory Wheel. For bringing problems up to the administration, I'm sure I can provide a student's perspective on some of the problems, but what type of problems specifically do you recommend be brought up? I sure Emory can fix the minor issues and minute QOL problems, but I'm less confident the school will take much input regarding vision and funding allocation.",

We won't even talk about how most were built and whether they've atoned for that. There is also the issue that they operate like big businesses which has its own implications that are hardly the best.\n\nAnd university students SHOULD try to connect what they are learning to real issues in the world just as faculty and administrators should, when they can or if applicable, use their research to inform how we understand it and attempt to make the world (or even just Atlanta which is amazing but just like any major metro area has so many contradictions and problems that it is unbelievable and sadly most are tied to the history of the country and region with regards to things like racial justice.  Like think of how amazing public transport would be in a place like Atlanta if it were not for a history of segregation.  It already is sadly the best/most robust transportation of a southern metro, but that sets the bar low and the impediments to expansion are ultimately political and socioeconomic issues related to race even if that is what people who oppose expansion won't say out loud).  For example, I really appreciate what this professor is doing for Atlanta and beyond:  [https://news.emory.edu/features/2021/04/emory-researcher-saikawa/index.html](https://news.emory.edu/features/2021/04/emory-researcher-saikawa/index.html)\n\nI appreciate what this professor did and is doing:  [https://news.emory.edu/features/2019/04/buried-truths/index.html](https://news.emory.edu/features/2019/04/buried-truths/index.html)\n\nAnd you as an UNDERGRADUATE can participate in this sort of work that changes and enhances the lives of others and potentially your own (people's career tracks have been changed by taking the Civil Rights Cold Case course.  It was around back in the dino ages when I attended, and I wish I found it).\n\nI am also fine with identity/affinity spaces because people shouldn't have to join a club to be with people they really relate to in terms of cultural expression and food right?  A club usually has specific and focused purposes whereas an affinity space is just communal.  Not to mention, cultural clubs can almost have too much specificity (like Korean, Chinese, Tibetan, Carribean, African, African American, etc) whereas an actual space is a \"pan\" sort of space and may have oppurtunities for different groups (like Latinos and blacks, or Asians and blacks or Latinos) to form coalitions (as well as nationalities within these groups).  I personally appreciate it, but I'm from a group that hasn't really been allowed to assimilate to whiteness in any meaningful way so it means something different to most of us than I imagine it would to some from Asian communities who supposedly are encouraged and somewhat allowed to assimilate (and benefit from assimilation) more.\n\nAs for this part:\n\n\"There were enough asians in HS where it was easy for me to hang around an only asian friend group. I was hoping to have this challenged in college.\"\n\nYou should not look at this as a form of segregation, but the fact that you said this is also a social justice issue of its own. Of course there will also be plentiful amount of Asian students at most elite tier colleges because of the way this country works (it is not purely about meritocracy.  The fact is, this country tends to make certain non-white groups whiter over-time through immigration policy and even through foreign policy or even domestic policy.  Remember that the Irish and Italians were not white when they were originally immigrating and we won't talk about some of the things outside of \"hard work\" that 'earned' them that status because it certainly wasn't pleasant), so you were going to be in this predicament at MOST elite universities (public or private).  It is always up to YOU to want to connect with others.  No college is going to force you to do so.  Though I must say, that to have a less diverse friend group at Emory, you really have to try.  It is easier if you are white or Asian I guess, but if you don't have a single URM in your social circle, you probably aren't trying. You'll have to challenge yourself.  There are like 8k undergrads and 7-7.5k graduate students.\n\nIt won't be that hard.  I personally made my Asian friends and mentees through tutoring them in ochem and I am probably not the type of black person they would typically envision themselves making friends with (as in I am not from a faux middle, middle, or upper middle class background of blacks, or immigrant black background.  My family is working poor and reflective of most blacks in the U.S., and not reflective of most blacks at schools like Emory) so anything is possible.  Emory is a very academic school, and often academics will be a great venue to connect with different people you would otherwise not expect to through, but social clubs allow for it too.  Honestly, I think the two black cultural clubs (not sororities and frats, there are more of those), BAM and Nambika (sp?) used to always have at least one or two token(not token in the bad way, to be used or to fill a quota, but just a person that stood out vs. the assumed target group) Asians in their group, so these orgs are welcoming of others. Even groups like ICE and the Indian dance team(s?) are.",

Also, I'm sleep deprived so my writing may be messy.\n\nYou and me probably hear different things when someone uses the terms \"Racial\" or \"Social Justice\". I don't mind the idea either, but in this particular case, Fenves gives so many more details on social justice than details on improving the university as a whole. As much of a responsibility Emory may have to groups it has historically discriminated against, I'd argue its responsibility to its students more generally is greater. While targeting retention rates is a good goal, I am looking for MORE good goals. He also doesn't explain HOW he's going to achieve this. There's no action plan, despite having one for the pandemic response and social justice. Perhaps only due to current events last year that he's decided to prioritize pandemic and social justice plans over more general plans since he wants to stay afloat. However, personally, I would've preferred a more ambitious president. \n\nI never quite understood pan asianism except as a voting block. Experiences vary so drastically the group just doesn't work. Culturally there're big differences. There's tons of discrimination between ethnic groups, often times within the same country (Chinese ethnic groups hate other Chinese ethnic groups, Han Chinese Singaporeans dislike \"native\" singaporeans.) Asian groups might actually be better off remaining in their subgroups. I don't think we benefit besides some of the people there looking like us. \n\nFrom my understanding though (you can correct me if I'm wrong on any of this), Black groups coalesce far better than Asians. Black Americans developed and share a common culture and roots from slavery, and American history more generally. The existence of Emory Black Student Union would already serve the purpose the identity space does (as a cultural group??).  For Latinos, frankly, the demographic is weird. Maybe they'd benefit from an identity space? Latinos is where race breaks down yet culturally much persists. But they're still culturally so different that I'm not sure if it's at all fair to lump them together (sort of like pan asianism).\n\n(I forgot to include middle eastern in here I think it'd be too much. I never liked categorizing based on race much.)\n\nMy problem isn't racially homogenous friends. Demographically, my HS is nearly identical to Emory's. Many friend groups often fell onto racial lines. I've had plenty of black, white, Hispanic friends. My problem is that I generally feel more comfortable around asians (the reasons are complicated), and so I default to hanging with them whenever I'm tired. Basically, I don't want a place where I can feel more comfortable just because people look like me. I don't want to have that sort of crutch. I rather focus on feeling more comfortable around people who don't look like me.\n\nIDK maybe I'm relating less to Asians because of how they look and more to do about experiences I can relate to. I have noticed I'm more comfortable around Queens and Manhattan kids than I am with Bronx, Brooklyn, and Staten Island kids.\n\nEdit: a good tldr is prob\nRace is an ineffective construct. And basing identity spaces off of it is even more silly as cultural groups do the job but better because it tailors to ethnicity rather than race.",

I don't dislike you. I don't even know you. I don't think I ever did anything to antagonize you except possibly pointing out the metaphor \"power point\" was vague (it was).\n\nYou weren't the only one who vented about their misgivings about their time at Emory. UnhappyCollegeKid did so before you, along with several others with problems and whatnot. I wanted a post to increase positivity and alleviate anxiety among those like me who are about to spend their first year at Emory. \n\nYou're perfectly allowed to vent about the experiences and aspects of Emory you didn't like. In fact, I'd encourage it. It's important to have a good balance of both positive and negative experiences. Your post had plenty of upvotes. But you should be fine with good anecdotes being around as well.",
