I\u2019ve been a social and economic activist for many years, and I heard that he was at this town hall, just minutes after I got off work. I left in such a hurry that I didn\u2019t even have money for the toll -- I had to leave an IOU instead. I was desperate to speak to him because my community had suffered so much, and I held onto the hope that he would hear me. Instead of cooking dinner for my youngest son, yet again, I went on a mission to beg for my children\u2019s future. I wanted them to have clean water, clean air, and a stable economic future. I was especially frustrated because the most-polluting coal baron in West Virginia, Jim Justice, became my Democratic Governor. His mountaintop removal coal-mining operation is just three miles from my house, and continues to put silica dust in the air and my childrens\u2019 lungs daily.\n\n---\n\n###When I approach my Senator, I told him about the water pollution, air pollution, and the fact that I buried most of my family because of coal mining with diseases like black lung and cancer. I told him that we all deserved clean and safe jobs. \n\n---\n\n\u201cWe would have to agree to disagree\u201d he told me, as he tried to bid the coal miners in the crowd against me. When I told him about my family dying, he turned to them and said they needed jobs -- as if that was more important than their own safety, and their families and surrounding communities being poisoned and dying.\n\nNot only did he act like he was immune to my struggle as a coal miner\u2019s daughter, he tried to divide and turn our community against one another. We shouldn\u2019t have to fight each other for basic human rights like clean water, clean air and have access to jobs to provide for our families.Little did Joe know that the coal miners in the crowd met and stood with me afterwards, and we talked about real solutions -- not just slogans.\n\nA month earlier, Sen. Manchin taunted voters to kick him out of office if they didn\u2019t like what he was up to. \u201cWhat you ought to do is vote me out. Vote me out! I\u2019m not changing. Find somebody else who can beat me and vote me out,\u201d he said. So, after my encounter with the Senator, I decided to take him up on his challenge -- I was going to take his seat from him, and return representation to the people of West Virginia.\n\nLike most of my generation I was born a coal miner\u2019s daughter and granddaughter. I have lived most of my life watching the progression and regression of coal. I have witnessed\nfirst-hand the impact it has on our health and communities. I have in lived poverty and in prosperity. I have tasted polluted water. I have enjoyed some of the cleanest water in the world -- that no longer exists. I have dealt with the suffering of burying family members far too soon and too young. I have lived in cancer-clustered communities. I live with the worry that my children will get cancer. I have watched my neighbors suffer on their way to the same fate. I can\u2019t help but feel overwhelmed with the frustration of what will happen to the people of Appalachia.\n\nThe promise of coal means more pollution, more cancer, and more black lung. The companies are still blowing up our mountains, burying our streams, destroying our heritage and devaluing our quality of life. We have no promise of a stable economic future with the market for coal being down. It has always been an unreliable and unstable economic resource. As many communities are forced to live in conditions comparable to a third-world country, people fear how they are going to provide for their families. No man or woman should have to choose between poisoning one child and feeding another.\n\nIt\u2019s past time to end the fear that divides us. We need to start standing up for each other. There are alternatives. We can invest in a diverse economy. I, for one, don\u2019t want my children to\ninherit the struggles that we have had to endure. \n\nI\u2019m proud to be a [Justice Democrat](http://www.justicedemocrats.com?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=PaulaJean&amp;utm_campaign=AMA0801) and a [Brand New Congress](http://www.brandnewcongress.org?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=PaulaJean&amp;utm_campaign=AMA0801) candidate. That means I take $0 in corporate donations or PAC money. Zero. I rely on 100% individual small donors. I\u2019ve watched how corporate money can twist even good politicians. I watched it happen to Sen. Manchin. I voted for him, long ago -- but I no longer recognize that man I voted for. It also means I support the [Brand New Congress platform](https://brandnewcongress.org/platform?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=PaulaJean&amp;utm_campaign=AMA0801), including Medicare for All, free public higher and vocational education, and moving to an expanded economy for West Virginia and America, based on renewable energy.\n\n**Social Media Links**:\n\n[Website](https://brandnewcongress.org/paulajean) | [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/paulajean2018) | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/paulajean2018)\n\n**Info Links**:\n\n[Ballotpedia](https://ballotpedia.org/Paula_Jean_Swearengin) | [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paula_Jean_Swearengin)\n\n**Other Important Links**:\n\n\n* /r/JusticeDemocrats\n* /r/BrandNewCongress\n* /r/Swearengin4Senate\n\n[Donate to my campaign.](https://secure.actblue.com/donate/paulajean2018?refcode=0801_reddit_ama&amp;amount=27.00) | [Sign up to volunteer.](https://now.brandnewcongress.org/act?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=PaulaJean&amp;utm_campaign=AMA0801) | [Platform](https://brandnewcongress.org/platform?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=PaulaJean&amp;utm_campaign=AMA0801)",
